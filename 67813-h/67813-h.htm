<p class="first">With his nephews as willing companions and eager listeners, Uncle Paul continued his
walks and talks in the pleasant summer afternoons.
</p>
<p>“Bread is made of flour,” he began, “and flour is wheat reduced to powder under the
millstone. What an interesting mechanism that is, the flour-mill, driven by water,
by the wind, sometimes by steam! What wearisome effort, what waste of time, if we
had not this invention and were forced to do its work of grinding by sheer strength
of arm!
</p>
<p>“I must tell you that in ancient times, for want of knowing how to grind wheat, people
had to content themselves with crushing it between two stones after parching it a
little over the fire. The coarse meal thus obtained was cooked in water to a sort
of porridge and eaten with no further preparation. Bread was unknown.
</p>
<p>“Later the plan was hit upon of kneading the meal with water and of cooking the dough
between two hot stones. Thus was obtained a crude sort of biscuit, about as thick
as your finger, stodgy and hard, <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>and mixed with charcoal and ashes. It was preferable to the porridge, the insipid
paste, of the earlier time, but far inferior to the poorest bread of to-day. To make
a long story short, by trial after trial success was at last attained in the making
of bread like ours. It became necessary then, without possessing anything to compare
with our mills, to grind wheat in large quantities.
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p004width"><img src="images/p004.png" alt="Wheat" width="268" height="329"><p class="figureHead">Wheat</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“Flour was obtained by triturating the wheat in a hollowed stone with a pestle. This
latter was sometimes light enough to be operated directly by hand; sometimes, to produce
quicker results, it was so large and heavy that it had to be turned in its stone mortar
with the help of a long bar. Such was the first mill. With appliances of this sort
I leave you to imagine how long a time was required for the production of a single
handful of flour. For bread enough to feed one person at one meal, wretched slaves
were kept toiling from morning till night and from night till morning in turning the
pestle.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span></p>
<p>“What cruel masters they must have had!” exclaimed Emile.
</p>
<p>“Yes, the slaves were harnessed to the bar like beasts of burden; and when, weakened
with fatigue, they did not go fast enough, a rawhide was applied to their bare shoulders.
These unfortunate millers were poor wretches taken in war and afterward sold in the
market with the same indifference with which a drover sells his cattle. Such, then,
were the hardships that led the way to the modern mill which to-day, with a few turns
of its water-wheel, and to the cheerful accompaniment of its <i>tick-tack</i>, can make flour enough for a whole family.
</p>
<p>“But let us leave the mill and turn our attention to the following interesting experiment.
Take a handful of flour and with a little water make it into dough. This done, knead
the dough with your fingers over a large plate while an assistant moistens it continually
with water from a pitcher. Keep the dough well in hand and continue kneading it, flattening
it out and gathering it together again, turning it over and over under the fine stream
of water poured from above.
</p>
<p>“Examine carefully the water that passes over the dough and washes it. It falls into
the plate as white as milk, showing that it carries with it something from the flour.
This something will finally settle at the bottom of the liquid, and we shall find
it to be a substance not unlike the starch used for starching linen. In fact, it is
starch, or fecula, as the chemists call it—neither more nor less. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>starch used in the laundry is obtained in considerable quantities by similar means:
dough is washed and the whitened water, left undisturbed, deposits a layer of starch
which has only to be gathered together and dried.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e844src" href="#xd31e844">1</a>
</p>
<p>“So much, then, is made clear: flour contains starch, but it contains something else
also. There is a limit beyond which the washed dough yields no more starch; it is
useless to knead it, the water falls colorless into the plate. What remains in one’s
hands after this prolonged washing is a soft, gluey substance, having something of
the elastic quality of rubber. Grayish in color, it has a rather pronounced odor.
When dried in the sun, it becomes hard and translucent like horn. It is called gluten
from its gluelike character, its viscosity.
</p>
<p>“Now this substance, so unattractive in appearance, all soft and sticky and getting
clogged between the fingers—this gluten, in short—do you know what it is? Don’t try
to dispute me, for what I am going to tell you is the exact truth. In its composition
gluten does not differ from flesh. It is vegetable flesh, capable of becoming animal
flesh by the simple process of digestion, without any material loss or gain. Therefore
it is gluten, first and foremost, that gives to bread its great nutritive value.
</p>
<p>“Of all the cereals wheat contains the most gluten, with rye holding second place.
Maize and rice, as well as chestnuts and potatoes, are wholly lacking <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>in this ingredient; and for that reason flour made from them, rich though it be in
starch, is not at all the kind of flour for bread. This will explain to you the superiority
of wheat over all other farinaceous grains.
</p>
<p>“Wheat, the only cereal that can give us white bread, that superior bread which nevertheless
is not always to your taste unless spread with a little butter, does not grow in all
countries. Open your atlas and run over with your finger the countries bordering on
the Mediterranean; your travels will embrace the principal regions where wheat flourishes.
Farther north it is too cold for the successful culture of the precious cereal; farther
south it is too warm.
</p>
<div class="figure floatRight p007width"><img src="images/p007.png" alt="Rye" width="146" height="294"><p class="figureHead">Rye</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“But that is not all. In the privileged regions not every district is adapted to this
incomparable crop: wheat needs the mild temperature and fertile soil of the plains,
not the harsh climate and dry slopes of the mountains. Let us consider France in particular.
Its plains produce excellent wheat, but not enough to feed the entire population;
therefore in the hilly and cooler regions, where this cereal cannot be raised, recourse
is had in the first place to rye, which yields a bread that is compact, brown, and
heavy, but on the whole preferable to any other except, of course, wheat. This rye
bread is the customary <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>food of the country in the greater number of our departments.
</p>
<p>“The raising of rye becomes in its turn impossible in regions too cold and too sterile.
There then remains, as a last resort, barley, the hardiest of cereals, which is found
in the mountains until we reach the neighborhood of perpetual snow, and can be raised
even in the frigid climate of the extreme North.
</p>
<p>“You ought to taste the miserable bread made from barley in order to find our bread
good—or, I might better say, in order to find it an exquisite dainty even without
butter or jam. Barley bread is full of long bristles that stick in the throat; it
contains more bran than flour; it is bitter, stodgy, and of a disagreeable odor. Oh,
what sorry stuff! And yet many have to be content with it, and are only glad if they
can get enough of it.

<p>“In the greater part of the world wheat, widely distributed by commerce, furnishes
bread only for the tables of the rich. The rest of the population knows nothing, as
a rule, of this article of food, has never so much as seen it, and at most has only
heard of it as a rare curiosity. In place of bread the people eat here one thing,
there another, according to the country. Asia has rice, Africa millet, America maize.
In India and China the people have hardly anything to eat but rice boiled in water
with a little <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>salt. Half the entire world has practically the same diet.
</p>
<p>“The plant that produces rice has a stalk resembling that of wheat, but instead of
ending in an upright ear it bears a cluster of feeble and pendent branches, all loaded
with seeds. The leaves are narrow and ribbon-shaped, rough to the touch. This plant
is aquatic. In order to flourish, it must send down its roots into the submerged mud
and spread its foliage, excepting the tip, in the flood. Marshy shallows, inundated
a part of the year, are adapted to its cultivation.”
</p>
<p>“But what do they do where there are no such marshes?” asked Louis.
</p>
<div class="figure floatRight p009width"><img src="images/p009.png" alt="Rice" width="92" height="265"><p class="figureHead">Rice</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“When such marshes are lacking, the ingenious Chinaman floods the lowlands with water
from some near-by stream until the ground is all soft and muddy. He then draws off
the water through a series of little canals, and works the mud with a light plow drawn
by a buffalo, a kind of ox with a long beard hanging from its chin and a mane waving
on its back.
</p>
<p>“The seed once sown in the furrows and the young plants started, the water from the
stream is again made to flood the fields, where it remains until harvest time. Then
for the second time it is drawn off, and the reaper, sickle in hand and with the black
mud up to his knees, cuts down the rice-laden tops of the stalks.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Maize, or Indian corn, is the staple food of South America, as rice is that of Asia.
Many call it Turkish wheat, a name doubly inappropriate, for in the first place this
grain is not indigenous to Turkey, but to America, and in the second place it has
nothing in common with the wheat from which bread is made. From America its cultivation
has spread to our part of the globe.
</p>
<p>“The ear of maize is very large and is composed of full, rounded kernels, yellow and
shiny, closely packed in regular rows. Like rice, maize furnishes a fine flour of
pleasing appearance but lacking in one essential: it contains no gluten. Hence the
utter impossibility of using either rice or maize for making bread, despite the good
appearance of the flour made from them.
</p>
<p>“Nevertheless maize is a very wholesome article of food, and one of great value in
the country, where the appetite is sharpened by open air and hard work. Only it is
not in the form of bread that it best yields its nourishment, but rather in that of
porridge, or boiled meal and water.”

<h2 class="main">THE HISTORY OF TOBACCO</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Before taking the form of the powder which the user of snuff pushes up into his nose
to tickle his nostrils and promote sneezing, before being rolled into the cigar or
reduced to that crisp, moss-like substance which the smoker stuffs into his pipe,
tobacco has had a previous existence as a plant bearing this same name. A stalk about
one meter in height, large, clammy leaves of a strong odor, bright red flowers each
shaped like a narrow funnel and expanding into the five points of a star at the orifice,
dry capsules filled with innumerable little seeds—there you have the tobacco plant.
</p>
<div class="figure floatRight p011width"><img src="images/p011.png" alt="Tobacco Plant" width="125" height="210"><p class="figureHead">Tobacco Plant</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“Only the leaves are used, and these only after undergoing certain processes that
intensify their natural properties and cause them to lose their green color. Rolled
into compact little cylinders, they become cigars; cut very fine, they take the form
of smoking tobacco. Reduced to powder, they furnish what is known as snuff.
</p>
<p>“America, the same land to which we owe the <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>potato, also gave us tobacco. When, almost four centuries ago, Christopher Columbus
discovered the new world, one of the first landings he made was on the large island
of Cuba. Apprehensive of danger in the forests from the savage tribes on every side,
Columbus sent scouts ahead to reconnoitre the country.
</p>
<p>“The sailors forming this party encountered on the way, to their extreme surprise,
numerous Indians, both men and women, holding each a sort of lighted fire-brand between
the teeth and inhaling the smoke. These fire-brands, called ‘tabagos,’ were made of
a plant rolled up in a dry leaf. There, then, were the first smokers and the first
cigars recorded in history.
</p>
<p>“The natives of Cuba and the neighboring islands had, we infer, been addicted to smoking
for a long time, probably for centuries, when the Europeans first appeared among them.
They had their rolls of dry leaves, or tabagos, and their smoking appliances of soft
stone or baked clay, appliances called by us ‘pipes’ and by them ‘calumets.’ Tobacco,
in fact, played a prominent part in their medicine, their superstitious observances,
and their political assemblies.
</p>
<p>“Consulted as to future events, the soothsayer first of all inhaled the smoke of several
tabagos, while the other persons present, seated in a circle, vied with one another
in the energy of their smoking, their ultimate object being to enwrap themselves in
a dense cloud. Then from the midst of this cloud <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>the soothsayer, his imagination wrought to a high pitch by the fumes of the tobacco,
delivered his oracles in unwonted terms that made the hearers believe they were listening
to the voice of God.
</p>
<p>“A like ceremony was observed in the assemblies held for discussing public affairs.
Seated on a stone and inhaling the smoke from his calumet, the orator who was about
to take the floor waited in passive silence while the chiefs of the nation approached
him, one at a time, to blow into his face plenteous puffs from their pipes and to
commend to him the interests of the tribe. These fumigations concluded, the orator
abandoned himself to his eloquence amid the enthusiastic acclaim of the assembly.
</p>
<p>“Seeing the islanders smoking, Columbus’s companions wished to try this singular custom
for themselves. To the gratification of this desire the Indian lent his ready assistance:
he showed them how the tabago is rolled, and how the calumet is filled and lighted.
Though history is silent on the subject, it is clear that the first sailor to undertake
the inhalation must have been seized with that fearful nausea which no novice in smoking
can escape. A stomach of any delicacy would have been forever repelled; the harsh
gullet of the mariner found a certain charm in the thing when once the trying experiences
of initiation were over.
</p>
<p>“The taste for smoking was so soon acquired that, on their return to Spain, the companions
of Columbus very quickly extended this Indian custom in their own country. Before
long, too, there was discovered <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>a new way to use tobacco: some one conceived the idea of reducing the leaf to a dry
powder and stuffing it into the nostrils, sniffing with each pinch of the powdered
substance. The Indian had discovered smoking tobacco; the European in his turn invented
snuff.
</p>
<p>“Spain and Portugal numbered their smokers and snuff-takers by the thousand when,
in 1560, tobacco made its first appearance in France. Nicot, French ambassador at
Lisbon, sent as an object of curiosity to his sovereign queen, Catherine de Médicis,
some seeds of the fashionable plant and a box of tobacco in powdered form. Charmed
with this gift, the queen quickly contracted the habit of taking snuff. To please
her, tobacco was cultivated, and snuff-takers soon became numerous in all the provinces.
It was said that a certain great personage of the period took as much as three ounces
daily. He certainly must have had his nose well tanned.
</p>
<p>“From one nation to another the use of tobacco gradually spread, but not without serious
opposition. The Turks are to-day passionately addicted to smoking, extremely fond
of their long pipes; yet hear what sort of a reception they at first gave to tobacco.
Against smokers and snuff-takers their emperor, Amurat, issued an edict severe to
the point of cruelty. Every delinquent was condemned to receive fifty strokes with
the rod on the soles of his feet.”
</p>
<p>“That ought to have driven tobacco out of the country in short order,” remarked Jules.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span></p>
<p>“That was merely a warning to first offenders,” returned his uncle. “For a second
offense the luckless person caught in the act had his nose cut off. It was a radical
measure to discourage the snuff-taker: no more nose, no more snuff. But the smokers,
after this horrible mutilation, persisted in their smoking.
</p>
<p>“A king of Persia devised what he thought would cure even this habit: every one caught
with a pipe in his mouth had his upper lip cut off. At the same time, of course, every
nose proved guilty of snuff-taking fell under the executioner’s knife. But the atrocious
edict of the Persian king proved as futile as that of the Turkish emperor. Despite
all the noses struck off, all the lips cut away, all the feet made to tingle under
the rod, the use of tobacco still continued to spread. These fruitless severities
had to be abandoned.
</p>
<p>“Other regulations sprang up here and there, less cruel, but sufficiently fruitful
in fines, imprisonments, vexations of all sorts. Still nothing was of any avail; smokers
and snuff-takers remained incorrigible. Finally, taking wiser counsel, the government
authorities conceived a plan for making this passion, which no severity had been able
to subdue, yield them large revenues. The government itself became exclusive vender
of the very article it had at first proscribed with such rigor. France alone derives
a yearly revenue of almost three hundred million francs from the sale of tobacco.”

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER III</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE ORIGIN OF FERTILE SOIL</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Fertile or arable soil,” resumed Uncle Paul, “constitutes only the surface layer
of earth, that which is worked by the farmer’s implements and yields nutriment to
the roots of plants and promotes their development. In one place you will see bare
rocks and utter barrenness; in another you find fertile soil to a depth of an inch
or two, scantily carpeted with grass; and again, in a third, you come upon rich earth
so deep as to maintain abundant vegetation. But nowhere does this fertile layer have
an indefinite thickness: at a depth never very considerable a subsoil having the qualities
of the neighboring mountains is sure to be found. How then has there come to be formed
this layer of earth whence is derived all the nutriment required by plants, animals,
and men?
</p>
<p>“Undermined all winter, and even the whole year round on high mountains, by the ice
that forms in their slightest fissures, rocks of all kinds break into small fragments,
divide into grains of sand, fall into dust, and furnish the powdery mineral matter
which the rain washes away and deposits in the valleys. This as a rule is the origin
of broken stones, sand, clay, and fertile soil. Ice by its expansive force has <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>detached them from the tops of mountains and the waters have swept them away and carried
them further. One can form an idea of the action of ice in crumbling rocks to make
soil of them and enrich the valleys, by examining the surface of a hard road at the
moment of thawing.
</p>
<p>Firm underfoot before freezing, this surface loses its firmness after a thaw and is
pushed up here and there in little finely-powdered clods. At the moment of freezing,
the humidity with which the soil was impregnated turned into ice which, increasing
in volume, reduced to fine particles the surface layer of the road. When the thaw
comes, these particles which the ice no longer holds together form first mud, then
dust. In exactly this manner arable land was formed by the disintegration of rocks
of all kinds, which were reduced to particles by the action of frost.
</p>
<p>But soil suitable for agriculture contains not only powdery mineral matter, but also
a little mold from the decomposition of vegetable matter. To give you an idea of the
causes which from the very earliest times have little by little fertilized this rock-dust
with vegetable mold, let us take the following example.
</p>
<p>Geography has taught you what a volcano is. It is a mountain whose summit is hollowed
out in an immense funnel-shaped excavation called a crater. From time to time the
ground trembles near a volcano and formidable noises similar to the rolling of thunder
and the booming of cannon are heard <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>from the depths of the mountain. The crater throws up into the air a lofty column
of smoke, dark by day, fiery red at night. All at once the mountain is rent and vomits
up through the crevices a stream of fire, a current of melted rock, or lava. Finally
the volcano quiets down; the source of the terrible flood dries up. The streams of
lava harden and cease running; and after a lapse of time which may be years they become
quite cold. Now what is to become of this enormous bed of black stone similar in character
to the slag from a forge? What will this sheet of lava covering an area of several
square miles produce?
</p>
<p>“This desolate, blasted expanse seems destined never to be clothed with verdure. But
in any such assumption one would be mistaken. After centuries and centuries a vigorous
growth of oaks, beeches, and other large trees will have taken root there. In fact,
you will see that air, rain, snow, and, above all, frost attack in turn the hard surface
of the lava, detach fine particles from it, and slowly produce a little dust at its
expense. On this dust there will spring into being certain strange and hardy plants,
those white or yellow patches, those vegetable incrustations, calculated to live on
the surface of stone and known as lichens. These lichens fasten themselves to the
lava, gnaw it still more, and in dying leave a little mold formed from their decaying
remains. On this precious mold, lodged in some cavity of the lava, there is now a
growth of mosses which perish in their turn and increase the quantity <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>of fertilizing material. Next come ferns, which require a richer soil, and after that
a few tufts of grass; then some brambles, some meager shrubs; and thus with each succeeding
year the fertile soil is added to from the new remnants of lava and mold left by the
preceding generation of plants that have gone to decay. It is in this way that gradually
a lava-bed finally becomes covered with a forest.
</p>
<p>“Our own arable land had a similar origin. Sterile rocks, hard as they are, contributed
the mineral part by being reduced to dust through the combined action of water, air,
and frost; and the successive generations of plant-life, beginning with the simplest,
furnished the mold.
</p>
<p>“Notice how admirably, in the processes of nature, the smallest of created beings
perform their part and contribute as best they can to the general harmony. To produce
fertile soil there is needed something more than the frosts and thaws that crumble
the hardest rock: there is need of plants hardy enough to live on this sterile soil,
such as tough grasses, mosses, lichens, which gnaw the stone. It is through the medium
of these rudimentary plants, so pitiful in appearance and yet so hardy, that the dust
of the rocks is enriched with mold and converted into a soil capable of bearing other
and more delicate plants.
</p>
<p>“It is not in cultivated fields that you will find those thick carpets of mosses and
lichens, valiant disintegrators of stone; it is on the mountain-tops that they can
be seen at their work of crusting over <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>the smooth rock in order to convert it into fertile soil. It is from these heights
that this fertile soil has descended, little by little, washed down by the rain, until
it has fertilized the valleys. This work is going on all the time; in hilly regions
plants of the lowest order are constantly adding to the extent of arable land. The
little threads of rain-water that furrow these regions carry away with them some of
this humus and bear it to the plains below.
</p>
<p>“What a worthy subject for our thoughtful study is this formation of arable soil by
these legions of inferior plants, obscure workers indefatigably crumbling the rock!
What immense results obtained by the simplest means!”

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h2 class="main">DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOIL</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Four substances, mingled in very variable proportions, enter into the composition
of fertile soil, or arable land, namely: sand or silica, clay, limestone, and humus,
or vegetable mold. Each one of these ingredients separately would make but very poor
soil, quite unsuited for agriculture; but united, mixed together, they <span class="corr" id="xd31e961" title="Source: fulfil">fulfill</span> the conditions necessary to fertility. Arable land generally contains all four, with
the predominance sometimes of one, sometimes of another. The soil takes the name of
its most abundant constituent. Thus have arisen the names, silicious soil, argillaceous
soil, calcareous soil, and humous soil, to designate the fertile lands dominated respectively
by sand, clay, limestone, and humus. Compound terms are also used. For example, when
it is said of a certain soil that it is argillo-calcareous, it is meant that clay
and limestone are its chief constituents.
</p>
<p>“Sand consists of particles, more or less minute, of very hard rock, sometimes opaque,
sometimes as transparent as glass, and always easily recognizable by its property
of emitting sparks when struck with steel. Flint and white pebbles belong to this
kind of rock, which is called silex, silica, or quartz. <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>These three expressions mean about the same. Sandy soils have little consistency,
are easily permeated by water, and freely absorb the sun’s heat, which makes them
very subject to drought.
</p>
<p>“The name of granite is given to a rock composed chiefly of silica and which forms
whole mountains, as in central France and in Brittany. The soil formed by the gradual
disintegration of this rock is sometimes called granite soil. It is not very good
for agriculture. Chestnut trees prosper in it, as well as certain wild plants characteristic
of this kind of land. The principal ones are the various species of heather and the
purple digitalis. Heather, with its dainty little pink blossoms, carpets in richest
abundance the poorest of sandy soils. The purple digitalis is a large-leaved plant
whose flowers, red on the outside, striped with purple and white inside, are arranged
in a long and magnificent distaff reaching almost to the height of a man. The flowers
are in the shape of long tun-bellied bells or, rather, glove-fingers; hence the plant
is sometimes called foxglove, sometimes lady’s fingers.
</p>
<p>“The soil composed of substances thrown up by volcanoes is also sandy, and is called
volcanic soil. It is generally black and sometimes very fertile.
</p>
<p>“Sandy-clay soil is found in the valleys of great rivers. It is the most fruitful
and the easiest to cultivate. Such are the soils of the Rhone valley, the valley of
the Loire, and that of the Seine. It is still more fertile if it is flooded by the
stream at high water. Then the river deposits a rich slime <span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>composed of clay and organic matter washed down by the current.
</p>
<p>“The soil of heathy or shrubby land is composed of fine sand and of humus from the
decayed leaves of heather and other plants. It is only used for flower gardens, and
furnishes an example of what might be called sand-and-humus soil.
</p>
<p>“Clay is a soil which, when moistened with water and thoroughly kneaded, becomes a
soft and tenacious dough, suitable for molding into any desired shape. When perfectly
pure it is white, and is known as kaolin, a rare substance of which porcelain is made.
Plastic clays are those that are unctuous to the touch, forming with water a yielding
mass that hardens with firing. They are used in making pottery. Smectite, or fuller’s
earth, is a clay of very different character, not pliable when moistened, but very
absorbent of grease and hence used by fullers for cleansing cloth of the oil left
on it in weaving. Ochres are clays colored either red or yellow by iron-rust. They
are used in coarse painting. Red chalk belongs to this class of clays. Marl is a mixture
in variable proportions of clay and limestone. According to which constituent predominates,
it is called argillaceous or calcareous. Subjected to the action of air and moisture,
marl becomes flaky and crumbles to dust. Marl is used in agriculture to improve the
soil.
</p>
<p>“A clay soil is quite the opposite of a sandy soil: water makes it swell and converts
it into a sticky paste which clings tenaciously to farming implements. <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>Once wet, it is cold, that is to say it dries very slowly. A spade can only divide
it into dense clods slow to crumble in the air and not fit for receiving seed. The
farmer must be careful to drain off the water and break up the ground by working it
before and during frosts. It is improved by mixing with it sand, coal-ashes, and lime.
Wheat flourishes better in a clayey soil than in any other kind.
</p>
<p>“Clayey soils are recognized by their vegetation. The wild plants peculiar to this
kind of soil are colt’s-foot and danewort. Colt’s-foot is also called horse-foot from
the shape of its leaves, the outline of which reminds one of a horse’s hoof. The leaves
are white underneath. The flowers are yellow like little marigolds, and they appear
at the beginning of spring before the leaves. Danewort is a kind of herbaceous elder
of about half the height of a man. Its small white flowers are succeeded by berries
full of a violet-red juice.”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Limestone is the rock from which lime is obtained. It is composed of carbonic acid
and lime. To obtain the latter, the limestone is subjected to intense heat in a furnace
or lime-kiln. The carbonic acid escapes, is dissipated in the air, and only the lime
remains. In arable land limestone is found rather often in smaller or larger pieces,
but more frequently as a fine powder which the eye can scarcely distinguish from the
other constituents, especially clay. The water of rivers and other streams almost
always contains a small proportion of dissolved limestone. Thence comes the thin layer
of stone that accumulates little by little on the inner surface of bottles, coating
the glass. Some waters contain enough of this dissolved limestone to deposit a mineral
crust on objects immersed in them, as mosses and aquatic plants, and to obstruct their
aqueducts. The clearest water, in which no foreign substance can be seen, absolutely
none, nevertheless contains dissolved limestone, just as sweetened water contains
invisible sugar. In drinking a glass of water we drink a little stone at the same
time. Our body, in order to grow strong and increase in size, <span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>needs considerable calcareous matter for the formation of bones, which are to us what
its solid framework is to a building. This material, so necessary to us, is not created
by us; we obtain it from our food and drink. Water plays its part in furnishing this
limestone, which it furnishes also to plants; they all contain a greater or less proportion
of this mineral matter.
</p>
<p>“Calcareous soils are whitish from their chief constituent, chalk. Entirely sterile
when the proportion of limestone is excessive, they are tolerably productive when
clay is added. They are especially suitable for vineyards and for raising lucerne,
sainfoin, and clover. Champagne and the south of France offer examples of this kind
of soil. Its principal varieties are chalky soil, which is nearly sterile, containing
as much as ninety-five per cent of chalk, and marly soil which is composed of clay
and chalk.
</p>
<p>“The plant-life characteristic of calcareous soils comprises the box-tree, whose compact
and fine-grained wood is so esteemed by turners; the wild cornel, whose red, olive-shaped
fruit is one of the best-liked autumn products that nature offers us; and the alkekengi,
or winter cherry, whose yellow berries are used for coloring butter. These berries
are encased in a large, gorgeously red membranous bag.
</p>
<p>“Wood, leaves, herbage, left a long time in contact with air and moisture, undergo
a slow combustion; in other words, they rot. The result of this decomposition <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>is a brown substance called humus or vegetable mold. The heart of old hollow willows
is converted into humus; it is the same with leaves that fall from the trees and rot
on the ground. Humus from the remains of earlier generations of plant-life nourishes
the plant-life of to-day, and this in turn will become mold from which future plants
will spring. It is in this way that vegetation is maintained in places not cultivated
by man. Humus, then, is nature’s manure. Where it is allowed to form freely, vegetation
never loses its vigor, using over and over again the same material, which takes alternately
the two forms of plant and humus. But hay from the field is stored in the hay-loft,
and the annual harvest of wheat is taken to the granary. Thus the land is robbed of
the mold that would be formed naturally by the rotting of this hay and wheat; therefore
we must give back to it, under some form or other, this mold that has been taken away,
since otherwise the soil will become less and less productive until finally it is
quite sterile. This restitution is made in the form of animal manure, which is a sort
of humus produced by digestive processes instead of by natural decay.
</p>
<p>“Humus plays a twofold part in the soil. First, it mellows the land, or in other words
makes it more easily permeable by air and water. Secondly, by the slow combustion
taking place in the humus there is constantly being liberated a small quantity of
carbonic acid gas, which is taken up by the adjacent roots. Agriculture can succeed
only in so far as the <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>soil contains humus. Wheat requires nearly eight per cent, oats and rye only two per
cent. In poor, sandy soils, to increase the amount of vegetable mold, it is customary
to plow certain green crops under, as the farmers express it; that is, the surface
soil is turned over and the growing crop intended for manuring purposes is buried
and left to decay in the ground. That is what is done when the plowman turns under
a field of growing grass or a stretch of clover. When it is proposed to improve a
piece of land by this process, it is the practice to begin by raising a crop (which
will later be turned under) that derives the greater part of its nourishment from
the air, since the soil in this instance cannot of itself furnish this nourishment.
Among the plants satisfying these conditions are buckwheat, clover, lupine, beans,
vetches, lucerne, and sainfoin.

<p>“Soils rich in humus have for their chief constituent the brown substance that results
from the decaying of leaves and other vegetable matter. Turf land stands first as
rich in humus. Turf is a dark, spongy substance that forms in moist lowlands from
the accumulation of vegetable refuse, especially mosses. Turf, or peat, as it is also
called, is used for fuel. To turn such a soil to account, it must first be made wholesome
by drainage, it must be mellowed by paring and burning and by the addition of sand
and marl, and a proportion of lime must be mixed in to hasten the decomposition of
all vegetable matter. Turf lands are recognized by their <i>sphagnei</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>great mosses that grow with their roots in the water; and by their flax-like sedges,
from the tops of which hang beautiful tufts of down having the softness and whiteness
of the finest silk.”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Let us burn a plant, no matter what kind. The first effect of the heat is to produce
carbon, which, mixed with other substances, constituted the plant. If combustion continues,
this carbon is dissipated in the air in the form of carbonic acid gas, and there remains
an earthy residue which we call ashes. Here then are two kinds of material, carbon
and ashes, which without exception enter into all plant-life. The plant did not create
them, did not make them out of nothing, since it is impossible to obtain something
from nothing. It must, then, have derived them from some source. We shall take up
before long the subject of coal and its origin, and shall find that it comes chiefly
from the atmosphere, whence the leaves obtain carbonic acid gas, which they decompose
under the action of the sun’s rays, retaining the carbon and throwing off the air
in a condition fit for breathing. The vegetation of the entire earth thus finds its
principal nutriment in the atmosphere, an inexhaustible and increasingly abundant
reservoir, because the respiration of animals, putrefaction, and combustion are continually
giving forth as much carbonic acid gas as the combined plant-life of the earth can
consume. To maintain <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>the fertility of his fields, therefore, the farmer need not give a thought to the
subject of carbon; with no assistance from him his growing crops find in the air all
the carbonic acid gas they require. There remains for our consideration, then, the
residue left after combustion, the ashes in fact, a mixture of various substances
of which we will now examine the most important.
</p>
<p>“Let us put a few handfuls of ashes to boil in a pot of water. After boiling a little
while we will let the contents cool. The ashes settle to the bottom and the liquid
at the top becomes clear. Well, we shall find this liquid emitting a peculiar odor,
exactly like that which comes from the lye obtained by passing water through a barrel
of ashes. We shall also find that it has an acrid, almost burning taste. This smell
of lye, this acrid taste were not in the water at first; they come from the ashes,
which have yielded a certain constituent to the water.
</p>
<p>“Hence we see that ashes must contain at least two substances of different kinds,
of which the principal one cannot dissolve in water, but settles at the bottom as
an earthy deposit, while the other, forming but a very small part of the whole, dissolves
easily in water and gives it its properties, especially its odor and its acrid taste.
</p>
<p>“If we wish to obtain this latter element by itself, we can very easily do so. All
that is necessary is to put the clear liquid into a pot over the fire and boil it
until all the water has evaporated. There will be left a very small quantity of whitish
matter resembling <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>table salt. But despite its appearance it is not table salt by any means; far from
it, as we shall quickly discover from its unbearable taste. It is known as potash,
and it is what makes lye so good for cleaning linen. Furthermore, of the various components
of ashes it is the one most essential to vegetation. Every tree, every shrub, every
plant, even to the smallest blade of grass, contains a certain proportion of it, sometimes
larger, sometimes smaller, according to the kind of plant-life, and therefore must
find it in the soil in order to thrive. Let us add that in growing plants potash is
not as the action of fire leaves it after the plants have been reduced to ashes. In
nature it is combined with other substances which free it from that burning acridity.
In the same way carbon, when combined with other elements, loses its blackness and
hardness; in fact, it is no longer common coal.
</p>
<p>“What else is there in ashes? A short account of the matter will tell us. In 1669
there lived in Hamburg, Germany, a learned old man named Brandt, whose head was a
little turned and who sought to turn common metals into gold. From old iron, rusty
nails, and worn-out kettles, he hoped to produce the precious metal. But he did not
succeed in his endeavors, nor was it destined that he should succeed, for the simple
reason that the thing is impossible. Never is one metal changed into another. When
he was about at the end of his resources he took it into his head to conceive a crowning
absurdity. He imagined that in urine would be found the ingredient <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>capable of turning all metals into gold. Behold him, then, boiling urine, evaporating
it, and cooking the disgusting sediment, first with this, then with that, until at
last one evening he saw something shining in his phials. It was not gold, but something
more useful: it was phosphorus, which to-day gives us fire. Don’t make fun of old
Brandt and his foolish cooking: in seeking the impossible he made one of the most
important discoveries. To him we owe the sulphur match, that precious source of light
and fire so easily and quickly used.
</p>
<p>“If you examine a sulphur match you will see that the inflammable tip contains two
substances: sulphur, laid on to the wood, and another substance added to the sulphur.
This last is phosphorus, colored with a blue, red, or brown powder, according to the
caprice of the manufacturer. Phosphorus by itself is slightly yellow in color and
translucent like wax. Its name means ‘light-bearer.’ When rubbed gently between the
fingers in the dark, it does indeed give out a pale gleam. At the same time there
is a smell of garlic; it is the odor of phosphorus. This substance is excessively
inflammable: with very little heat or with slight friction against a hard surface,
it catches fire. Hence its use in the manufacture of matches.
</p>
<p>“Phosphorus is a horribly poisonous substance. By melting a little of it in grease
a poison can be obtained that will destroy rats and mice. Crusts of bread are smeared
with this composition and exposed in places frequented by these animals. A nibble
is <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>enough to ensure speedy death. Hence you perceive that because of their poisonous
nature matches are to be handled with extreme care. Contact with food might produce
the gravest consequences.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span></p>
</div>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h2 class="main">PHOSPHATES AND NITROGEN</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Phosphorus, which is a dangerous poison, as we have seen, is nevertheless found in
abundance in the bodies of all animals. It occurs in the urine, whence Brandt was
the first to extract it; it is found still more plentifully in the bones, and from
thence it is now obtained. There is some in meat, in milk, and in cheese; also in
plants, notably cereals; hence flour and bread contain it. But do not be alarmed:
we shall not die of poison like the rats that have nibbled crusts smeared with grease
and phosphorus.”
</p>
<p>“But why not,” asked Emile, “if we eat it as the rats do?”
</p>
<p>“I will try to explain,” replied his uncle. “When two or more substances are mixed
together, they lose their original properties, while the new substance obtained by
their combination is found to possess new properties having nothing in common with
the old ones. Thus carbon, when combined with the air that we breathe, becomes an
invisible gas, subtle, and unfit for breathing. In like manner lime, burning to the
taste, is converted by union with carbonic acid gas into chalk, a calcareous stone
void of taste. Furthermore, poisonous substances, deadly in a very <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>small dose, may become harmless and even enter into the composition of our food when
they are combined with other substances. Thus it is with phosphorus. What, then, is
united with phosphorus in the form in which it ceases to be poisonous and enters into
the composition of meat and flour? That is what we will now consider.
</p>
<p>“When phosphorus is burned it produces a thick white smoke, of which you can get some
idea by striking a number of matches all at once. This white smoke with the slightest
trace of humidity is reducible to an extraordinarily acid liquid called phosphoric
acid. Since this compound results from the combustion of phosphorus, just as carbonic
acid is the result of the combustion of carbon, it must and in fact does contain the
air without which no combustion can take place. Phosphoric acid is no longer inflammable,
however much it may be heated; being itself the product of combustion, it cannot burn
again. But if there is no danger of its catching fire, phosphoric acid is nevertheless
dangerous on account of its intense acidity, which makes it violently corrosive in
its action on flesh. If mixed with lime, however, this formidable compound loses its
injurious properties and is changed into a white substance without the least taste
or the slightest poisonous effect. This substance is called phosphate of lime. Burnt
phosphorus and lime, thus united, furnish the greater part of the mineral matter found
in bones. Put a bone into the fire: the grease and juices that permeate its substance
will be burnt up and the bone will <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>lose a part of its weight and become friable and perfectly white. Well, this bone,
calcined in the fire for a long time, is composed chiefly of phosphate of lime. It
contains phosphorus, the most combustible of substances, and yet is itself absolutely
incombustible; it contains one of the most poisonous substances, and yet is itself
quite harmless; into its composition there has entered an ingredient possessing atrocious
acidity, and yet the compound itself has no taste. Similarly combined and equally
harmless, phosphorus is found in meat, milk, cereals, in flour and bread.
</p>
<p>“A cow can furnish each week about 70 liters of milk containing 460 grams of phosphate.
This phosphate comes from hay, which obtains it from the soil. But as the soil contains
only a moderate quantity of it, and the hay continually takes it away, the supply
will at last become exhausted and the milk will become poorer and less abundant. If
a kilogram of powdered bones, containing about the same quantity of phosphate as the
70 liters of milk, is spread over the pasture, it will make good the weekly loss in
phosphate that the soil undergoes in the production of the cow’s milk. Hence the efficacy
of powdered bones on exhausted pasture land.
</p>
<p>“Phosphoric acid combined with other substances is found in all our agricultural products,
and hence the phosphate from bones has a very marked effect on our crops. Harvests
have been doubled as if by magic through the use of powdered bones. A kilogram of
this powder contains enough phosphoric <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>acid for the growth of a hundred kilograms of wheat. Despite their great value as
a fertilizer bones will never be thus used except to a limited extent, because they
are not abundant enough and also because they are much in demand in various arts and
manufactures. Fortunately in some localities phosphate of lime is found in certain
coarse pebbles called nodules or coprolites. These precious stones are carefully collected
and ground to powder in a mill. Then, in order to make the substance more soluble
in damp soil, and thus better fitted for the nutrition of plants, it is sprayed with
an extremely corrosive liquid called sulphuric acid or, more commonly, oil of vitriol.
In this way is obtained the superphosphate of lime which manufacture gives to agriculture
as one of the most powerful of fertilizers, especially for the raising of grain.
</p>
<p>“We were wondering a little while ago what substances could be contained in the ashes
of a burnt plant, and we have now found potash to be one of them. Moreover, since
all vegetation must have phosphate in order to thrive, this also ought to be found
in the ashes, phosphate being indestructible by heat. And, in fact, after the incineration
of any vegetable matter whatever, as a bundle of hay or a handful of grain, the delicate
processes of science can always recover this compound of phosphorus; and they further
find lime, iron in the form of rust, the silicious component of pebbles, and divers
other substances of less interest.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>“To finish this difficult but very important subject of the nutrition of plants, I
must say a few words about ammonia. This word does not tell you anything since it
is a new word to you. But I will make its meaning clear to you by a familiar illustration.
</p>
<p>“You must have noticed the strong, penetrating odor prevalent in ill-kept water-closets;
and you have also perceived the same odor when soiled garments are cleaned with a
certain liquid that looks like clear water. Well, this odor, so pungent that it almost
produces the effect of fine needles thrust up into the nostrils and brings tears to
the eyes, is the odor of ammonia.
</p>
<p>“Ammonia is an invisible gas capable of being taken up in large quantities by water,
the mixture being known as <i>aqua ammoniæ</i>, or water of ammonia. Combined with other substances ammonia loses its pungent odor
and forms compounds which are among the most effective fertilizers. These compounds
furnish vegetation with one of its essential ingredients called nitrogen. By itself
nitrogen is an odorless and colorless gas. In this state it forms four-fifths of the
volume of ordinary air, the air we breathe. The other fifth is composed of a second
gas called oxygen, also colorless and odorless. It is oxygen that our lungs demand
when we breathe, and it is oxygen that is necessary when we wish to burn anything.
It is this alone that plays its invaluable part in the combustion of certain substances
in our blood and in the generation of natural heat; it is this that <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>in the process of combustion releases carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, and other combustibles,
to combine with them and produce a compound known as carbonic acid gas in the case
of burnt carbon, phosphoric acid in the case of phosphorus. In fact, to it belong
the properties that we have until now attributed to the atmosphere as a whole. As
for nitrogen, it has no other purpose in the atmosphere than to moderate by its presence
the too violent energies of oxygen; it plays there the part of the water that we put
into too strong wine.
</p>
<p>“All vegetation requires nitrogen. Wheat, for example, must have it to develop the
grain in the ear; peas, beans, lentils demand it in order to fill out their pods;
the pasture and the hay-field need it if they are to furnish the nutriment that the
sheep and the cow will transform into milk. But plants cannot take this nitrogen from
the air, where it is so abundant; it must be served up to them after a certain necessary
preparation. We ourselves need phosphorus, since it enters into the composition of
our bones; we need carbon still more, the principal fuel used in maintaining the heat
of the body. But are we to eat the charcoal that the charcoal-burner manufactures
in his furnace, and the phosphorus used in the making of matches? Certainly not. The
first would be a frightful mouthful, the second an atrocious poison. We must have
them prepared in a suitable way, such as they are found in bread, milk, meat, fruits,
vegetables. In the same manner plant-life requires nitrogen, not as it occurs in the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>atmosphere, but as it exists in certain combinations, of which the most notable are
the compounds of ammonia. This explains to us the highly beneficial effect of manure
on our crops. Manure is composed of the bedding used in stables and the animal excrement
with which it has become mixed and impregnated. Now this excrementitious matter, especially
urine, yields ammonia in decomposing, as is proved by the odor arising from latrines
in hot weather and so powerfully affecting the eyes and nose. Thus manure may be said
to hold ammonia compounds in storage, and from them plants derive their nitrogen,
as also many other ingredients.
</p>
<p>“Let us summarize these details. In the nutrition of plants four substances are of
prime importance. First, carbonic acid gas, which yields carbon, the most widely diffused
of all the elements (but which we need not dwell upon here), since plants take it
chiefly from the atmosphere, to which it is supplied unceasingly. After carbonic acid
come potash, phosphoric acid, and nitrogen, all of which the roots extract from the
soil, where it occurs in some compound or other. These are the ingredients that the
soil, if it is to remain fertile, must have given back to it as fast as they are exhausted
by the crops. Such is the part played by fertilizers, without which the soil becomes
exhausted and ceases to produce.”

<h2 class="main">VEGETATION AND THE ATMOSPHERE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The carbonic acid gas produced simply by the breathing of the great human family
amounts every year to about 160,000,000,000 cubic meters, which represents 86,270,000,000
kilograms of burnt carbon. Piled up, this carbon would form a mountain one league
round at its base and between four hundred and five hundred meters high. So much carbon
is required by man to maintain his natural heat. All of us together eat this mountain
of carbon in our food and in the course of the year dissipate it all in the air, a
breathful at a time; after which we immediately begin the dissipation of another mountain
of carbon. How many mountains of carbon, then, since the world was created, must mankind
have exhaled into the atmosphere!
</p>
<p>“We must take account, too, of the animals, which, collectively, those of the land
and those of the sea, use up a big mountain of combustible matter. They are much more
numerous than we; they inhabit the entire globe, both continents and seas. What a
quantity of carbon it must take to sustain the life of our planet! And to think that
it all goes forth into the air, as a deadly gas, of which a few breaths would cause
death!
</p>
<p>“Nor is that all. Fermentation, as in grape-juice <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>and rising dough, and putrefaction, as in decaying manure, produce carbonic acid gas.
And it needs only a light layer of manure to cause a cultivated field to give forth
between one hundred and two hundred cubic meters of carbonic acid gas per day for
each hectare.
</p>
<p>“The wood, coal, and charcoal burnt in our houses, and especially the quantities consumed
in the great furnaces of factories—are not they also returned to the atmosphere in
the form of harmful gas? Just think of the amount of carbonic acid gas vomited into
the atmosphere by a factory furnace into which coal is poured by the carload! Think
also of the volcanoes, gigantic natural chimneys which in a single eruption throw
up such quantities of gas that furnaces offer no comparison. It is very clear: the
atmosphere is constantly receiving carbonic acid gas in torrents that defy computation.
And yet animal life has nothing to fear for the present or for the future, since the
atmosphere, though continually being poisoned with carbonic acid gas, is at the same
time always being purged of it.
</p>
<p>“And what is the purgative agent commissioned by Providence to maintain the salubrity
of the atmosphere? It is vegetation, my friends, vegetation, which feeds on carbonic
acid gas to prevent our perishing and turns it into the bread of life for our sustenance.
This deadly gas, which absorbs into itself all sorts of putrefaction, is the choicest
of nourishment for plant-life; and thus out of the bosom of death the blade of grass
builds up new life.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span></p>
<p>“A leaf is riddled with an infinite number of excessively minute orifices, each encircled
by two lips which give it the appearance of a half-open mouth. They are called <i>stomata</i>. On a single leaf of the linden more than a million can be counted, but so small
are they as to be quite invisible without a magnifying-glass. This picture shows you
how they look under a microscope. Well, through these orifices the plant breathes,
not pure air such as we breathe, but poisoned air, fatal to an animal but wholesome
for a plant. It inhales through its myriads of millions of stomata the carbonic acid
gas diffused through the atmosphere; it admits this gas into the inner substance of
its leaves, and there, under the sun’s rays, a marvelous process follows. Stimulated
by the light, the leaves operate upon the deadly gas and take from it all its carbon.
They unburn (the word is not in the dictionary, more’s the pity, for it gives the
right idea)—they unburn the burnt carbon, undo what combustion had done, separate
the carbon from the air with which it is bound up; in a word, they decompose the carbonic
acid gas.
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p044width"><img src="images/p044.png" alt="Stomata on a Linden Leaf" width="183" height="230"><p class="figureHead">Stomata on a Linden Leaf</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“And do not think it any easy thing to unburn a burnt substance, to restore to their
original condition two substances united by fire. Scientists would need <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>all the ingenious means and powerful drugs they possess to extract carbon from carbonic
acid gas. This task, which would tax the utmost resources of the man of science, leaves
accomplish noiselessly, without effort, even instantaneously, and with the sole requirement
that they shall have the aid of the sun.
</p>
<p>“But if sunlight fails, the plant can do nothing with the carbonic acid gas, the chief
item in its diet. It then pines away with hunger, shoots up as if in quest of the
missing sunshine, while its bark and leaves turn pale and lose their green color.
Finally it dies. This sickly state induced by the absence of light is called etiolation.
It is artificially produced in gardening for the purpose of obtaining tenderer vegetables
and of lessening or even entirely removing the too strong and unpleasant taste of
some plants. In this way some salad greens are bound with a rush so that the heart,
deprived of the sun’s rays, may become tender and white; and thus, too, celery is
banked up and left to whiten, since otherwise its taste would be unbearable. If we
cover grass with a tile or hide a plant under a pot turned upside down, we shall after
a few days of this enforced darkness find the foliage all sickly and yellow.
</p>
<p>“When, on the other hand, the plant receives the sun’s rays without hindrance, the
carbonic acid gas is decomposed in no time, the carbon and the air separate, and each
resumes its original properties. Freed of its carbon, the air becomes what it was
before this admixture: it becomes pure air, fit to maintain <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>both fire and life. In this state it is restored to the atmosphere by the stomata
to be used again in combustion and respiration. It entered the plant as a fatal gas,
it leaves it as a vivifying gas. It will return some day with a new charge of carbon,
which it will deposit in the plant, and then, restored to purity once more, it will
recommence its atmospheric round. A swarm of bees goes and comes, from the hive to
the fields and from the fields to the hives, on one trip lightened and eager for booty
and on the other heavily laden with honey and returning to the comb on wearied wing.
In the same way air on coming to the leaves is charged with carbon from an animal’s
body, a burning fire-brand, or decaying matter; it gives it to the plant and departs
for a fresh supply.
</p>
<p>“It is thus that the atmosphere preserves its salubrity despite the immense torrents
of carbonic acid that are cast into it. The plant lives on deadly gas. Under the action
of the sun’s light it decomposes the gas into carbon, which it keeps for building
up its own substance, and breathable air, which it returns to the atmosphere. From
this carbon combined with other substances come wood, sugar, starch, flour, gum, resin,
oil, in fact every kind of vegetable product. Animal and plant are of mutual assistance,
the animal producing carbonic acid gas, which nourishes the plant, and the plant changing
this deadly gas into air fit to breathe and into food. Thus our dependence on plants
is twofold: they purify the atmosphere and they give us food.”

<h2 class="main">LIME</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To make mortar with which masonry is held in place it is customary to use lime. In
a sort of trough lined with sand are placed lumps of stone having a calcined appearance,
and on these stones water is poured. In a few moments the pile becomes heated to high
temperature, cracks and splits and finally crumbles into dust, at the same time absorbing
the water, which disappears little by little as it is taken up by the solid matter
or vaporized by the heat. More water is added to reduce it all to paste, which is
finally mixed with sand. The product of the mixture is mortar. Such is the process
often witnessed by Emile and Jules, who are always surprised, that stone, by having
water poured on to it, should become hot and turn the water into jets of steam. “Lime,”
Uncle Paul explained to them, “is obtained from a widely diffused stone called limestone
or, in more learned language, carbonate of lime. The process is of the simplest sort.
It consists of heating the stone in kilns built in the open air in the vicinity of
both limestone and fuel, so as to avoid the expense of transportation in the manufacture
of a product that it is desirable to furnish at a low price.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span></p>
<p>“A lime-kiln is about three meters high, and is lined with fire-proof brick. An opening
at the bottom serves for taking out the lime when the firing has continued long enough.
In filling the kiln it is the usual practice to begin by laying large pieces of limestone
so as to form a sort of rude vault over the fireplace, and on this vault are piled
smaller fragments until the entire cavity is filled. The fuel used may be fagots,
brushwood, turf, or coal. After the firing has gone on long enough, operations are
suspended and the lime is withdrawn by breaking down the vault supporting the entire
mass, which crumbles and comes crowding out at the lower opening, whence it is usually
removed.
</p>
<p>“Another method still followed in some localities and of more ancient origin consists
of filling the kiln with alternate layers of fuel and limestone. The whole rests on
a bed of fagots that serves for starting the fire. As soon as the fire has spread
throughout the mass, the opening at the top is closed with pieces of sod in order
to make the combustion slower and more even.”
</p>
<p>“Nothing could be simpler,” said Jules, “than lime-making. Now I should like to know
what effect the heat of the kiln has on the limestone. How does it happen that stone
turns into lime by passing through fire?”
</p>
<p>“Limestone,” answered his uncle, “contains two different substances: first, lime,
and then an invisible substance, impalpable as air itself, in fact, a gas, carbonic
acid gas. The name of carbonate of lime <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>given to the limestone denotes precisely this combination. As it is when taken from
the ground, the stone contains the two substances closely united, so incorporated
indeed as no longer to have the qualities characterizing them when apart. Heat destroys
this union: the lime stays in the kiln, and the carbonic acid gas is dissipated in
the atmosphere with the smoke from the burnt fuel. After this liberation of the gas
the lime is left in its pure state, no longer masked by the presence of another substance,
but just as it is needed by the mason for making mortar.”
</p>
<p>“Then all that the fire does,” queried Jules, “is just to break apart the limestone
and drive out the carbonic acid gas that it contained?”
</p>
<p>“What takes place in the lime-kiln,” replied his uncle, “is nothing but the separation
of the lime and the gas. Now let us turn our attention to the mortar. When lime is
watered, it gets very hot, swells, cracks open, and crumbles into a fine powder like
flour. The heat that is generated comes from the violence with which the two substances
rush together. Before absorbing water lime is called quicklime; after this absorption,
which has reduced it to powder, it is called slaked lime. This slaked lime is reduced
to a paste with water, and then well mixed and kneaded with sand. The result is the
mortar used in laying stone and brick in order to hold the courses firmly together
and give solidity to the building.
</p>
<p>“There is one thing I advise you to note, if you have not already done so, since it
will explain to you <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>the part played by mortar in masonry. Look at the water that for several days has
covered a bed of lime slaked by the masons. You will see floating on the surface small
transparent particles resembling ice. Well, these tiny fragments of crust are nothing
but stone like that from which the lime was obtained; in a word, they are limestone
or carbonate of lime. To make stone of that kind two substances are necessary, as
I have just told you: lime and carbonic acid gas. The lime is furnished by the water,
in which it must be present in solution, since the water covers a thick bed of this
material; and as to the carbonic acid gas, it is furnished by the air, where it is
always to be found, though in small quantities. Lime, then, has this peculiarity,
that it slowly incorporates the small amount of carbonic acid gas present in the atmosphere,
and so once more becomes the limestone that it was before.
</p>
<p>“A similar process goes on in mortar: the lime takes back from the atmosphere the
gas that it had lost in the heat of the lime-kiln, and little by little becomes stone
again. The sand mixed with it serves to disintegrate the lime, which thus more easily
absorbs the air necessary for its conversion into limestone. When the mortar has fully
resumed the form of limestone the courses of masonry are so strongly bound one to
another that the stones themselves sometimes break rather than give way.
</p>
<p>“What is known as fat lime is lime that develops great heat when brought into contact
with water, and also increases considerably in volume, forming with <span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>the water a thick, cohesive paste. On the other hand, poor lime develops but little
heat, disintegrates slowly, and increases scarcely any in volume. The first kind comes
from nearly pure limestone and can be mixed with a large proportion of sand, thus
making a great quantity of mortar. The second kind is obtained from limestone having
various foreign substances and will admit of but a small admixture of sand, thus yielding
less mortar than the other. Both have the property of hardening in the air by the
absorption of carbonic acid gas which converts them into limestone.
</p>
<p>“There is a third variety of lime called hydraulic lime, which has the peculiar merit
of being able to harden under water. It is made from a limestone containing a certain
proportion of clay. Hydraulic mortar is used for the masonry of bridges, canals, cisterns,
foundations, vaults, in fact for all stone and brick work under water or in damp soil.”

<h2 class="main">LIME IN AGRICULTURE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“To be fertile a soil must contain limestone, sand, and clay, besides the organic
substances coming from humus and fertilizers. Now it may be that nature has not endowed
the soil with a sufficient quantity or with any of these three constituents. Then
the character of the soil must be corrected by giving it what it lacks. That is what
is called improving the land. Thus a soil that is too sandy is improved by the addition
of limestone and clay; one that is too compact, too clayey, is improved by adding
sand and, still more, by adding limestone. Mineral substances thus added to the soil
to correct it are called correctives. These substances coöperate also in the nutrition
of plants, and from this point of view may be regarded as mineral fertilizers.
</p>
<p>“One of the most valuable of correctives is lime, which is indispensable to soils
lacking limestone, indispensable also to the nutrition of nearly all our cultivated
vegetables. It acts in various ways. First, it energetically attacks vegetable substances,
decomposing them and converting them into humus. A pile of leaves that would take
long months to rot becomes in a short time a mass of humus when mixed with lime. Hence
its great utility in fields overgrown <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>with weeds, and in newly cleared land—in short, wherever there are old stumps, piles
of leaves, remnants of wood, and patches of heather, which need to be decomposed.
With the help of lime all these herbaceous or woody substances are quickly converted
into humus, with which the soil becomes enriched to the great advantage of future
crops.
</p>
<p>“In the second place, lime corrects or neutralizes the acidity peculiar to certain
soils, as is proved by the following experiment. Let us mix some vinegar, no matter
how strong, with a little lime. In a short time the smell and acid taste of the vinegar
will have disappeared. Now wherever masses of vegetable refuse, such as leaves, mosses,
rushes, old stumps, are undergoing decay, there are produced certain sour-tasting
substances or, in other words, acids, which are invariably harmful to agriculture.
This generation of acid occurs notably in turfy soils, which have an excessive acidity
favorable to the growth of coarse rushes and sedges that are valueless to us, and
at the same time this acid is highly injurious to all our cultivated plants. Lime,
therefore, which is sure to correct this acidity, works wonders in marshy lands, damp
meadows, and turfy soils. We are warned of the need of lime by the appearance of ferns,
heather, sedge or reed-grass, rushes, mosses and sphagnei.
</p>
<p>“Thirdly, when once mixed with the soil, lime speedily resumes the form it wore before
passing through the lime-kiln; that is to say, it becomes limestone, but in the shape
of fine powder. This return <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>to the limestone condition is brought about by union with the carbonic acid gas coming
from the atmosphere or thrown off by the substances decaying in the ground. Under
this new form lime continues to play a useful part by supplying the calcareous ingredient
to soil that lacked it, and also by preventing the clay from becoming too cohesive,
too impervious to air and water.
</p>
<p>“The addition of lime to the soil should take place at the end of summer, when the
ground is dry. Little heaps of quicklime, each containing about twenty kilograms,
are placed at intervals of five meters and covered with a few spadefuls of earth.
In a short time the moisture in the atmosphere reduces the lime to a fine powder,
which is then spread evenly with a shovel and covered with earth—an operation involving
no severe labor.
</p>
<p>“Lime should never be applied with seed. Mere contact with it would burn the young
shoots. Neither should it be mixed with manure before it is used, since the immediate
result would be a total loss of great quantities of ammonia, thrown off in gaseous
form; and ammonia, as I have explained, is one of the richest of fertilizers. Lime
and manure, therefore, should be used separately.
</p>
<p>“Soils rich in turf, clay, or granite are the ones on which lime acts most beneficially.
Because of the important results attained by the use of lime, its manufacture for
purely agricultural purposes by certain expeditious and effective methods is customary
in many places. Thus in Mayenne, where this application <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>of lime has converted tracts of uncultivated clayey land into rich pastures or into
wheat fields of exceptional fertility, lime is made in enormous kilns a dozen meters
high and supported by the cliff that furnishes the limestone and sometimes the fuel
also.
</p>
<p>“All animal matter makes excellent fertilizer. Of this class are old woolen rags,
stray bits of leather, fragments of horn, dried blood from slaughter-houses, and flesh
not fit for human consumption. All these substances are rich in nitrogen and phosphates,
and if mixed with farm manure they add greatly to its value. Lime furnishes us the
means of utilizing one of these substances, flesh, in the best way possible.
</p>
<p>“Dead bodies of animals, heedlessly left for dogs and crows and magpies to devour,
should be cut up in pieces and then buried with a mixture of earth and quicklime.
This attacks the flesh and quickly decomposes it, so that in a few months’ time there
would be available a deposit of the most powerful fertilizer instead of a useless,
disease-breeding carcass. As to the bones, resistant to the action of lime, they are
burned to render them more friable, and then reduced to powder. This bone-dust, mixed
with the fertilizer furnished by the decayed flesh, will contribute to grain-field
or pasture a rich supply of phosphorus. To uses of this sort the farmer should put
all horses and mules that have had to be killed, as well as all large farm animals
that have died of disease.”

<h2 class="main">PLASTER OF PARIS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Though less important than lime, plaster of Paris is nevertheless much used in building,
especially for ceilings, molded chimney-pieces, and in the filling of cracks and cavities.
It is a white powder which is made into a paste by adding water, prepared a little
at a time and only as fast as needed.”
</p>
<p>“I’ve seen them do it,” Emile interposed; “the workman takes a few handfuls of that
powder out of a bag, and then he mixes it with a little water in his trough with a
trowel. He scrapes the paste all together in his hand and uses it immediately, before
making any more. Why don’t they mix all the plaster at once, as they do with lime
when they make mortar?”
</p>
<p>“Plaster is not all prepared beforehand for the reason that it hardens very quickly,
turns to stone, and is then unfit for use. Accordingly, to have it in a suitable state
of softness, it must be prepared at the moment of using.”
</p>
<p>“And what do they make that powder of that turns to stone when it is mixed with water?”
</p>
<p>“Plaster is made from a stone called gypsum, which, always the same as to its nature,
varies much <span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>in appearance according to its state of purity. Sometimes it is a shapeless rock,
whitish and more or less grained; sometimes a fine fibrous mass with a silky luster;
or, again, a substance as transparent as glass and splitting into very thin scales
which show, here and there, the superb colors of the rainbow. Struck by their beauty,
workmen engaged in quarrying gypsum have given the name of ‘Jesus-stone’ to these
brilliant laminæ. Also, from their brilliance and their cheapness, they are called
‘donkey’s mirrors.’ In ancient times these beautiful sheets of transparent gypsum
were used as window-panes.
</p>
<p>“Impure gypsum, in the form of shapeless rock, is used for ordinary plaster, while
pure gypsum, which comes in glass-like sheets or in blocks of a silky appearance,
is used for fine plaster, as in all sorts of molding. The stone from which plaster
is obtained occurs in abundance in several departments of France, where it forms hills
and even whole mountains, as for example in the departments of the Seine, the Mouths
of the Rhone, and Vaucluse. For conversion into the usual plaster of Paris this stone
must be subjected to a moderate heat. To this end it is the practice to build with
gypsum blocks a row of small vaults, and on these vaults to pile fragments of smaller
size. Then the firing is done by burning fagots and brushwood under these vaults.”
</p>
<p>“And is it carbonic acid gas this time, too, that is driven out by the heat, as in
the manufacture of lime?” asked Jules.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>“No, my friend: gypsum does not contain any carbonic acid gas. It is made of lime,
as in limestone, but united with sulphuric acid, which heat is powerless to drive
out. Besides this it contains water, which forms a fifth of the total weight of the
stone. This water, and nothing further, escapes under the action of heat. With this
expelled the gypsum is turned to plaster.
</p>
<p>“But this latter has a strong tendency to take on again the moisture parted with in
the kiln, and thus to become once more what it was in the beginning—primitive stone.
It is this peculiarity that renders gypsum suitable for plaster. Moistened in the
trough, the powdery matter quickly incorporates the water that is thus restored to
it, and the whole hardens into a block having the solidity of gypsum that has not
yet passed through the kiln. Lime turns to stone by being permeated with carbonic
acid gas, which restores it to its limestone state. Plaster becomes stone by absorbing
water, which brings it back to the state of gypsum. The transformation of lime is
slow, of plaster very rapid.
</p>
<p>“As soon as it comes from the kiln plaster is ground under vertical millstones and
then sifted. The powder must be kept in a very dry place, since it contracts moisture
easily and then will not harden or set, as they say, when mixed with water. You will
perceive clearly enough that after being more or loss impregnated with moisture plaster
cannot have the same tendency to absorb the water necessary to change it into a solid
mass; the substance <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>being already somewhat soaked will not show the same thirst when the time comes for
using it. All damp and, still more, all wet plaster is of no further use.
</p>
<p>“Statues, busts, medallions, and various other ornamental objects are made by casting
with fine plaster of Paris. This is prepared from the purest gypsum, those beautiful
transparent scales I told you about a little while ago. It is heated in ovens similar
to those used by bakers, and cut off from contact with the burning fuel, so as to
preserve its whiteness. The powder, which looks like fine flour, is mixed with water
and reduced to a smooth paste, which is then poured into molds. When the plaster has
set, the mold, which is in several pieces, all joined together, is taken apart and
the finished cast withdrawn.”

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h2 class="main">PLASTER OF PARIS IN AGRICULTURE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“In agriculture plaster of Paris has by no means the importance of lime; nevertheless
it produces excellent results on clover, sainfoin, and lucerne. It is used in the
spring for sprinkling the young leaves when they are still damp with the morning dew.
Still, foggy weather is the most favorable for this work. Plaster also acts well on
rape, flax, buckwheat, and tobacco, but has no effect on cereals.
</p>
<p>“The intelligent farmer puts plaster of Paris to still another use. In every dunghill
there is always going on a slow combustion, or fermentation, giving forth ammonia
in vaporous form; and this ammonia escapes into the air as a total loss, whereas it
ought to be retained as far as possible in the manure, since the compounds of ammonia
constitute the source whence plants obtain nitrogen. Therefore to prevent this waste,
plaster is sprinkled over the dunghill. Sometimes, too, it is sprinkled over each
layer of manure as the pile rises. The plaster absorbs the ammoniac vapors, gives
them a little of its sulphuric acid, and converts them into a compound, sulphate of
ammonia, which is proof against vaporization. Hence we say that plaster of Paris fixes
<span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>ammonia, that is to say prevents its being dissipated.
</p>
<p>“To illustrate the fertilizing effect of plaster of Paris on lucerne, the following
incident is related. Franklin, one of the chief glories of the United States of North
America, aware of the great fertilizing power of plaster, wished to extend the agricultural
use of this substance among his fellow-citizens; but they, clinging to old customs,
would not listen to him. To convince them, Franklin spread plaster over a field of
lucerne by the side of the most frequented road leading out of Philadelphia, but spread
it in such a way as to form letters and words. The lucerne grew all over the field,
but much taller, greener, and thicker where the plaster had been applied, so that
the passers-by read in the field of lucerne these words traced in gigantic letters:
‘Plaster of Paris was applied here.’ The ingenious expedient was a great success and
plaster was very soon adopted in agriculture.”
</p>
<p>“The doubters must have been convinced,” said Jules, “on seeing those big green letters
rising above the rest of the lucerne. Did not Franklin do some other remarkable things?
I remember the name; I have seen it several times in books.”
</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied his uncle, “Franklin became by his learning, one of the most remarkable
men of his time. Among other things, we owe to him the invention of the lightning-conductor,
that tall pointed iron rod erected on the roofs of buildings to protect them from
the thunderbolt. It was he who first had the <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>superb audacity to evoke the lightning from the midst of the thunder-clouds, to direct
it according to his wishes, and to bring it to his feet that he might study its nature.
One stormy day in 1752 he went out into the country near Philadelphia in company with
his young son who carried a kite made out of a silk handkerchief tied at the four
corners to glass rods. A pointed piece of metal terminated the apparatus. A long hemp
cord, with a shorter cord of silk tied to the lower end, was fastened to the kite,
which was then sent up toward a black thundercloud. At first nothing happened to confirm
the previsions of the American sage, and he was beginning to despair of success when
there came a shower of rain and with it a flash of lightning. The wet cord proved
a better conductor than when dry. Without thinking of the danger he ran, and transported
with joy at having brought within his reach that which causes thunder, Franklin put
his finger near the cord and made little spurts of fire dart out, lighted brandy from
these sparks out of the sky, and only brought his perilous experiment to an end when
he had fully determined the origin and nature of thunder and lightning. This was the
way he studied the mystery at close quarters, discovered its nature, and finally succeeded
in protecting buildings by means of a pointed iron rod.
</p>
<p>“Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston, North America, in 1706. He was the youngest<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1205src" href="#xd31e1205">1</a> of seventeen <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>children. Hence, as his father was a poor tallow-chandler and soap-boiler, he could
not acquire at home anything beyond a knowledge of reading, writing, and arithmetic.
At ten years of age he was taken from school and set to performing small tasks about
the house. He cut candle-wicks and poured the tallow into the molds, waited on customers
in his father’s shop, and ran errands. His work brought him in a few pence which he
did not yet know how to spend judiciously. He tells us the following little story
on this subject, which we may all profit by.
</p>
<p>“ ‘One day,’ says he, ‘finding myself the possessor of a handful of coppers, I ran
out to buy some toys, when a little boy of about my own age happened to pass that
way with a whistle in his hand. Delighted with the sound of the whistle, I proposed
to my comrade to exchange all my money for his musical instrument. To this he very
willingly agreed. Elated with my purchase, which I thought very fine, I returned home,
where I continued whistling to my great joy, but to the great displeasure of the ears
of my family. I told them of the magnificent exchange I had just made. My brothers
and sisters made fun of me, saying that for the price I had paid I might have bought
dozens of such whistles at the toy-shop. Only then did it occur to me what fine things
I might have bought with my money, and I began to cry with vexation. Chagrin at the
exchange I had made now caused me more pain than the whistle had before given me pleasure.
This little incident made an impression <span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>on me that has never been effaced and has been of service to me on more than one occasion.
Ever since, whenever I am tempted to buy some useless thing, I say to myself, “Do
not pay too much for your whistle”; and so I save my money.’ ”

<h2 class="main">NATURAL FERTILIZERS—GUANO</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Plant-life finds a part of its sustenance provided by nature in the atmosphere; it
finds carbonic acid gas, whence it derives the carbon it requires; but the care and
ingenuity of man have to supplement these natural resources by providing fertilizers.
</p>
<p>“One of the chief of these fertilizers, farm manure, is furnished by the bedding and
excrement of animals. To obtain an excellent dressing of this sort it is customary
to use for bedding, as far as possible, the straw from grain, since this, being composed
of hollow stalks, is capable of holding considerable moisture. But, as in certain
cases straw would hardly be able to absorb all the fluid matter, it is well to make
a trench in the stable and thus carry off the excess of liquid to a reservoir outside,
where another heap of straw or similar material is in readiness to receive it. Then,
at a distance from all rain-spouts and gutters, and in the shade of trees, a substantial
layer of clay is spread on the ground, and on this is erected the pile of manure.
All around it is dug a little trench which conducts the brown liquid that oozes from
the manure, and that is known <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>as liquid manure, into a hole large enough to admit of the use of a bucket in drawing
out the liquid.
</p>
<p>“Liquid manure is composed of the fluid matter with which the bedding is steeped,
and it holds in solution a great part of the nutritive constituents of the manure.
Agriculture knows no richer fertilizer. Hence care should be taken not to let it go
to waste in neighboring ditches or soak into the ground. That is why the pile is placed
on a layer of clay, which keeps the liquid manure from soaking into the ground where
it would be wasted; and it is also the reason for digging a trench to receive this
fluid matter and conduct it to the hole. When this hole is full the liquid manure
is drawn out with a bucket and thrown back on to the dung-hill.
</p>
<p>“Nor is that the whole of the story. A slow combustion will soon begin throughout
the pile of manure; its mass will ferment and become heated, and as a consequence
the nitrogenous constituents will decompose and will liberate ammonia, which will
escape into the air and be lost if the fermentation is excessive. It is to avoid too
rapid a heating that the manure-pile is placed in the shade and not under the direct
rays of the sun. Moreover, the liquid manure thrown on to the heap from time to time
also moderates the fermenting process.
</p>
<p>“Compare this careful method with the practice on most farms, where the manure is
heaped up without any precaution, without shelter from the sun, unprotected from the
drenching rains, which wash away the soluble constituents. Think of those rivulets
<span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>of liquid manure trickling away in this direction and that, and collecting here and
there in puddles of infection. See how all the inmates of the poultry-yard scratch
at the heap, turning over and scattering its contents, and thus causing the ammonia
to escape into the atmosphere. Can such a dung-hill be as valuable as one that is
attended to properly?
</p>
<p>“Liquid manure being the richest part of the whole pile, care should be taken not
to let escape what the bedding does not absorb. It should be first diluted with water
and then applied to the growing crops. When it is desired for use in non-liquid form,
it should be mixed with enough earth to absorb it, and the result is an excellent
fertilizer.
</p>
<p>“In summer it is not unusual to enclose with hurdles a piece of land soon to be cultivated,
and into this enclosure a flock of sheep is driven to pass the night under the care
of the shepherd in his movable hut, and with the protection of trusty dogs well able
to cope with any marauding wolves. The next night the flock is quartered in another
spot, and so on until the entire field has thus served, a little at a time, as stable
for the flock. The purpose of this procedure is to utilize the excrement, both solid
and liquid, left behind by the flock. In one night a sheep can fertilize a square
meter of surface. This method of fertilizing is very effective because of the complete
absorption of the fluid matter by the soil.
</p>
<p>“Off the coast of Peru in South America are several small islands which form a common
rendezvous for great numbers of sea-birds. Birds that frequent <span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>the sea are all notorious for their insatiable appetite. Constantly in search of fish,
which they live on, they spend the day exploring the surface of the waters at immense
distance from land. Nature has endowed them with prodigious flying power. To these
indefatigable rovers an aërial promenade of some hundreds of leagues before dinner
is a mere nothing. Scattered during the day in all directions in quest of prey, they
reach the islets in the evening to spend the night, arriving in flocks so dense as
to darken the sky. Being well fed, thanks to their foraging excursions, they cover
the ground at night with a thick layer of excrement. And as this has been going on
century after century ever since the world was made, these deposits, piled one on
another, have at last become massive beds twenty or thirty meters thick, and so hard,
so compact, that to break them it is necessary to use a pick or a petard, just as
one would in quarrying stone. Workmen operate this dung mine, and vessels from all
parts of the world fetch cargoes of this valuable material, which is called guano.
This enormous mass of dung, which has by the lapse of ages been turned into a sort
of whitish loam, gives Peru an annual revenue amounting to sixty millions of francs.

<span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Guano is the strongest fertilizer known to agriculture. It is scattered broadcast
over the field when vegetation is starting, and for the best results a rather damp
time is chosen for this work in order that the moisture may convey to the roots of
the plants, by gradual infiltration, the soluble constituents of the fertilizer. The
action of guano on vegetation is of the promptest, most powerful sort.”

<h2 class="main">THE STALK OF THE PLANT</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The stalk is the common support of the plant’s various parts. It is called annual
or herbaceous when it lives only one year, as in the potato, spinach, parsley, and
all forms of vegetation that from their soft structure belong to the class of herbs.
Ligneous is the name given to the stalk when, designed to live for a greater or less
number of years, it is made of strong woody fibers, such as we find in the trunks
of trees.
</p>
<p>“Let us make a clean cut through any tree-trunk, that of an oak for example. We shall
find it divided into three parts: in the center the pith or marrow, very slightly
developed; around the marrow the wood proper; and, finally, on the outside, the bark.
A closer examination shows that the wood is formed of concentric layers which are
indicated in the cross-section by a series of circles having the marrow for a common
center. These layers are called ligneous zones or, since one is formed every year,
annual layers. During the summer there is a downward flow, throughout the tree, of
a peculiar liquid, the descending sap, which constitutes the fluid nourishment of
the tree. This liquid runs between the wood and the bark and becomes, little by little
in its course, <span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>on one side a layer of wood which attaches itself to the outer surface of the preceding
year’s layer, and on the other side a thin sheet of bark which is added to the inner
surface of the bark already formed.
</p>
<p>“Thus each year both bark and wood form a new layer; but this added layer is applied
in opposite ways in the two instances,—outside on the wood, inside on the bark. The
wood thus encircled from year to year by new layers increases in age toward the center
and becomes younger and younger toward the circumference, whereas the bark, lined
every year with a fresh sheet, shows its youth on the inside and its age on the outside.
The first buries inside the trunk its decrepit and dead layers; the second thrusts
its old layers outside, where they crack and fall off in large scales. This aging
process is simultaneous on the outside and in the center of the tree-trunk; but between
the wood and the bark life is always at work, creating fresh accretions.
</p>
<div class="figure floatRight p071width"><img src="images/p071.png" alt="Cross Section of Tree Trunk" width="152" height="150"><p class="figureHead">Cross Section of Tree Trunk</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“Here are some experimental proofs of this annual formation of a ligneous layer. A
strip of bark is removed from the trunk of a tree, and on the wood thus laid bare
is fastened a thin sheet of metal. The bark is then replaced and bound with ligatures
so that the wound may heal. We will suppose ten years have passed. The bark is raised
again at the same place. The metal sheet is no longer visible; to find it you must
bore deep into the wood. Now, <span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>if you count the ligneous layers removed before reaching the metal sheet, you will
find precisely ten, just the number of years that have passed.
</p>
<p>“A number of observations like the following are familiar: Some foresters cut down
a beech bearing on its trunk the date 1750. The same inscription was found again in
the inner substance of the wood, but to reach it they had to cut through fifty-five
layers on which no mark whatever appeared. If now, we add 55 to 1750 we obtain precisely
the year when the tree was felled, or 1805. The inscription carved on the trunk in
the year 1750 had passed through the bark and reached the layer of wood that was then
outermost. Since that event fifty-five years had passed and new layers, exactly the
same in number, had grown over the first.
</p>
<p>“Thus a tree is composed of a succession of woody sheaths, the outer ones enveloping
the inner. The stem or trunk contains them all; the branches, according to their age,
contain more or fewer. Each one represents a single year’s growth. The woody sheath
of the present year occupies the exterior of the trunk, immediately under the bark;
those of former years occupy the interior, and the nearer they are to the center the
older they are. The layers of future years will come one at a time and take their
places over preceding layers, so that what is now the outermost layer will in its
turn be found embedded in the body of the trunk.
</p>
<p>“Of all these ligneous zones of unequal age the most important to-day is the outside
one; its destruction <span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>would cause the death of the tree, since through it the nutritive juices of the earth
reach the buds, leaves, and young branches. In their time the interior layers, one
by one, when they formed the surface, rendered the same service to the buds of their
day; but now that these buds have become branches the inner layers have only a secondary
office, or even none at all. Those nearest the outside still have some aptness for
work and help the layer of the year to carry the juices from the earth to the branches.
As to the innermost ones, they have lost all activity; their wood is hard, dried up,
encrusted with inert matter. In their decrepitude these interior layers are incapable
of service in the work of vegetation; the most they can do is by the support of their
firm woody structure to give solidity to the whole. Thus the tree’s activity decreases
from the outside toward the center. On the surface are youth, vigor, labor; in the
center old age, ruin, repose.”

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE ROOT</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The stalk or trunk is the upward-growing part of the plant, and needs air and light.
The root, on the contrary, is the downward-growing part, and it needs soil and darkness.
The extreme ends of the root’s various subdivisions are always growing, always young,
of delicate structure, and for that reason admirably fitted for imbibing, very much
as a fine sponge would do, the liquids with which the soil is impregnated. Because
of their facility in absorbing moisture these ever-growing tip-ends are called spongioles.
The spongioles terminate the rootlets, that is to say the final subdivisions of the
root, subdivisions known as root-hairs on account of their resemblance to real hair.
</p>
<p>“The root takes various forms, which are all reducible to two fundamental types. Sometimes
it consists of a main body or tap-root, which sends out branches as it bores deeper
into the soil. This designation, tap-root, is a common and familiar term. Sometimes
the root assumes the form of a tuft, a bunch of rootlets, simple or branching, which,
springing from the same point, continue to grow at a nearly equal rate and on an equal
footing as to importance. <span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>Roots of this sort are commonly known as fibrous roots.
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p075width"><img src="images/p075.png" alt="Roots" width="286" height="348"><p class="figureHead">Roots</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“As a general rule, the growth of the root keeps pace with that of the stem or trunk.
Thus the oak, elm, maple, beech, and all our large trees have a vigorous, deep-growing
root as anchorage for the enormous superstructure, to brace it firmly against the
wind. But there is no lack of lowly herbage that has roots quite out of proportion
to the other parts,—veritable tap-roots of greater size and vigor than many a plant
of far greater aërial development can boast. To this class belong the mallow, carrot,
and radish. Lucerne has for support to its meager foliage a root that bores two or
three meters into the ground.
</p>
<p>“An agricultural practice of supreme interest is based, at least partly, on the excessive
development of certain roots. The plant is a laboratory where life converts into nutritive
matter the manure from <span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>our stables and poultry-yards. A cart-load of dung becomes at the farmer’s pleasure,
after passing through one sort of plant or another, a crop of peas or beans, a basket
of fruit, or a loaf of bread. Hence this fertilizer is a very precious thing which
nothing can replace and which must be utilized to the very utmost. The nourishment
of us all depends on it. Enriched with this fertilizer, the soil produces, we will
say, a first harvest of wheat. But wheat with its bunch of short and fine roots, has
drawn only upon the upper layer of fertilizing material, leaving intact all that the
rain has dissolved and carried down into the lower layers. It has performed its mission
admirably, it is true; it has made a clean sweep and converted into wheat all the
fertilizer contained in the layer of soil accessible to its roots, so that if wheat
were sown a second time no harvest would be obtained. The soil, then, is exhausted
on the surface, but in its underlying strata it is still rich. Well, what crop shall
we choose for the utilization of these lower strata and the production of still further
supplies of food? It cannot be barley, oats, or rye, since their little fibrous roots
would find nothing to glean in the surface soil after the first crop of wheat. But
it will be lucerne, since this plant will send down its roots, each as thick as your
finger, to the depth of one, two, or even three meters, if need be, and give back
the fertilizer in the form of forage, which, with the help of the animal that feeds
on it, will be converted into nutritious meat, valuable dairy products, excellent
wool, or, at the very least, <span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>animal power for draft service or other work. This succession of two or more different
kinds of crops for the utmost utilization of a given area of prepared soil is called
rotation of crops, of which there will be more to say later.
</p>
<p>“Deep roots, so admirably adapted to the utilization of the lower strata of the soil,
become in other circumstances a source of serious difficulty. Suppose a tree is to
be transplanted. Its long tap-root will make the operation difficult and hazardous.
You must dig deep, both in pulling it out and in replanting it; and then you must
be careful not to injure the root, for it is all in one piece and if it does not take
hold and grow the sapling will die. In this case it would be much to the tree’s advantage
to have fibrous roots running down only to a slight depth; it could then be pulled
up easily, and if some roots perished in the operation enough would be left intact
to insure the success of the transplanting.
</p>
<p>“This result can be obtained: it is no difficult matter to make the tree lose its
tap-root and acquire, not a regular bundle of roots of even length; but a short and
much ramified root that possesses the advantages of the bunch of small roots without
having its shape. Thus in nurseries where young trees remain for some years before
being transplanted, after two years’ growth a spade is passed under the surface of
the soil to cut off the main root, which would in time become a deep tap-root. The
stump that remains then branches out horizontally without going deeper. Another way
is to pave the nursery <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>bed with tiles. The tap-root of the young tree pushes downward until it reaches this
barrier, where it is straightway forced to stop growing in depth and compelled to
send out lateral branches.
</p>
<p>“The kind of root we have thus far been talking about is primordial, original; every
plant has it on emerging from the seed; it appears as soon as the seed germinates.
But many plants have other roots that develop at different points of the stem, replacing
the original root when that dies, or at least coming to its aid if it continues to
live. They are called adventitious roots, and they play a highly important part, notably
in certain horticultural operations such as propagating by slips and layers, which
we will talk about later.
</p>
<p>“Besides these two operations, the object of which is to multiply the plant, it is
customary to prompt the growth of adventitious roots either for the purpose of fixing
the plant more firmly in the ground or in order to increase its yield. The best way
to attain this result is to bank up the earth at the base of the stalk. This process
is sometimes called earthing up. The buried portion soon sends out a great number
of roots. Indian corn, for example, if left to itself is too poorly rooted to resist
wind and rain, which beat it down. In order to give it greater stability the farmer
earths up the corn. In the earth banked up at the base of the stalk bundles of adventitious
roots form and furnish the plant a firmer support.
</p>
<p>“Wheat stalks bear on their lower ends buds <span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span>which, according to circumstances, perish to the detriment of the harvest or develop
into roots and promote the growth of more ears of grain. Let us suppose wheat has
been sown in the autumn. In that cold and rainy season vegetation is slow, the stalk
grows but little, and the various buds remain very close together almost on a level
with the ground. But if they are favored by having damp soil near them, these buds
send forth adventitious roots which nourish them directly and promote a fullness of
growth that the ordinary root by itself could not have secured. Thus stimulated by
nourishment, these buds develop into so many wheat-stalks, each one ending at a later
period in an ear of grain. But if wheat is sown in the spring, its rapid growth under
the influence of mild weather brings the buds too high for them to send out roots.
The stalk then remains single. In the first case from one grain of wheat sown there
springs a cluster of stalks producing as many ears; in the second case the harvest
is reduced to its lowest terms: from one grain of wheat one stalk, one ear. Hence
this development of the lower buds of cereals is of the greatest importance. To obtain
it, or, in agricultural terms, to make the wheat send up suckers, the lower buds must
send down adventitious roots, as they will do if they are brought into contact with
the soil. To this end, shortly after germination a wooden roller is passed over the
field, and this roller, without bruising the young stalks, pushes them deeper into
the ground.”

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h2 class="main">BUDS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Let us take a branch of lilac or any shrub. In the angle formed by each leaf and
the branch that bears it, an angle called the axil of the leaf, we shall see a little
round body enveloped in brown scales. That is a bud or, as it is also named, an eye.
</p>
<p>“Buds make their appearance at fixed points, and it is the rule for one to form in
the axil of each leaf; it is also the rule for the tip-end of the branch to bear one.
Those situated in the axils of the leaves are called axillary buds, and those that
are found on the ends of branches, terminal buds. They are not all equally vigorous,
the strongest being at the top of the branch, the weakest at the bottom. The lower
leaves even shelter such small ones in their axils that only the closest scrutiny
will reveal them. These diminutive buds often perish without developing unless artificially
encouraged to do so. On a lilac branch it is easy to note these differences of size
from bud to bud.
</p>
<p>“Both terminal and axillary buds are divided into two classes. In developing some
sprout up and produce only leaves; these are called leaf buds. When fully developed
they become shoots or scions, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>finally branches. Others push upward but little and bear only flowers or leaves and
flowers simultaneously. They are called flower buds, or simply buds. It is very easy
to distinguish one kind from the other on our fruit-trees, the leaf buds being long
and pointed, the flower buds round and thicker.
</p>
<p>“All summer long the leaf buds grow in the axils of the leaves; they are gaining strength
to go through the winter. Cold weather comes and the leaves fall, but the buds remain
in their place, firmly implanted on a ledge of the bark, or a sort of little cushion,
situated just above the scar left by the falling of the adjacent leaf. To withstand
the rigors of cold and dampness, which would be fatal to them, winter clothing is
indispensable. It consists of a warm inner envelope of flock and down, and a strong
outer casing of well varnished scales. Let us examine for instance the bud of a chestnut-tree.
Within we shall find a sort of wadding enswathing its delicate little leaves, while
on the outside a solid cuirass of scales, arranged with the regularity of tiles on
a roof, wraps it closely. Furthermore, to keep out all dampness, the separate pieces
of this scale armor are coated with a resinous cement which now resembles dried varnish,
but softens in the spring to let the bud open. Then the scales, no longer stuck together,
separate, all sticky, and the first leaves unfold covered with a velvety red down.
Nearly all buds, at the time of their spring travail, present in different degrees
this stickiness resulting from the softening of their resinous coating. I will mention
<span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>especially the buds of the ash, alder, and, above all, the poplar, which when pressed
between the fingers emit an abundant yellow glue, of bitter taste. This substance
is diligently gathered by the bees, which use it to make their bee-glue, that is to
say the cement with which they stop the fissures and rough-coat the walls of their
hive before constructing the combs. Under its modest appearance the bud is a veritable
masterpiece: its varnish excludes dampness; its scales protect it from harmful atmospheric
influences; its lining of flock, wadding, downy red hair, keeps out the cold.
</p>
<p>“The scales form the most important part of the bud’s winter clothing. They are nothing
more nor less than tiny leaves hardened and toughened, in short so modified as to
serve the purpose of protection. The leaves immediately under them and constituting
the heart of the bud have the usual form. They are all small, pale, delicate, and
arranged in a marvelously methodical manner so as to take up the least possible room
and at the same time to be contained, all of them, despite their considerable number,
within the narrow limits of their cradle. It is surprising what a quantity of material
a bud can make room for under its sheath of scales in a space so small that we should
find it difficult to pack away there a single hemp-seed; and yet it holds leaves by
the dozen or a whole bunch of flowers. The bunch enclosed in a lilac bud numbers a
hundred and more blossoms. And all this is contained in that narrow cell, with no
tearing or bruising of any <span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>portion of it. If the various parts of a bud were disconnected, one by one, if the
delicate arrangement were once undone, what fingers would be clever enough to put
it together again? The principal leaves lend themselves to a thousand different modes
of arrangement in order to occupy the least space possible. They take in the bud the
form of a cornet; or they roll themselves up in a scroll, sometimes from one edge
only, sometimes from both; or they fold up lengthwise or crosswise; or they may roll
up into little balls, or crumple up, or fold like a fan.”

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h2 class="main">ADVENTITIOUS BUDS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Buds such as we have been considering appear in the spring and then spend the summer
in gaining strength, after which they remain stationary and as if wrapped in deep
sleep all through the winter. The following spring they wake up and grow into branches
or blossom into flowers. It is plainly to be seen that these dormant buds, as arboriculture
calls them in its picturesque language, must, in order to withstand the summer heat
and the winter’s cold, be clothed so as not to be parched by the sun or killed by
the frost. They are all in fact covered with a wrapping of scales, and for that reason
are called scaly buds. Buds of this class are found in the lilac, chestnut, pear,
apple, cherry, poplar, and in fact nearly all the trees of our country.
</p>
<p>But if a tree can wait and devote a whole year to the development of its buds, which
are clothed in a sheath of scales because of this waiting, there are a multitude of
plants that have only a limited time at their disposal: they live only a year, and
hence are called annuals. Such are the potato, carrot, pumpkin, and a great many more.
In a few months or days they must hastily develop their buds. These, not having to
pass through the winter, are <span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>never enveloped in protecting scales: they are naked buds. As soon as they appear
they elongate, unfold their leaves, and become branches taking part in the work of
the whole. Very soon, in the axils of their leaves, other buds make their appearance
and behave like their predecessors; that is to say, they develop quickly into branches
which in their turn produce other buds. And so on indefinitely until winter puts a
stop to this scaffold of branches and kills the whole plant. Thus annuals ramify rapidly.
In one year they produce several generations of branches implanted one on another,
sometimes more, sometimes fewer, according to their species and their degree of vigor.
Their buds, designed for immediate development, are always naked. On the contrary,
those forms of vegetation that have a long life, such as trees, ramify slowly; they
have only one generation of branches a year, and their buds, destined to live through
the winter, are scaly.
</p>
<p>Certain examples of plant-life have both kinds of buds. Such, for instance, are the
peach-tree and the grape-vine. At the end of winter the vine-shoot bears scaly buds
lined with flock, and the peach branches scaly buds coated with varnish. Both belong
to the class of dormant buds: they have slept all winter in their sheaths of fur and
scales. In the spring they develop into branches according to the general rule; but
at the same time there appear in the axils of the leaves other buds without any protecting
covering, and these develop immediately into branches. Thus the grape-vine and the
peach-tree <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>beget two generations in one year: the first, the issue of the scaly buds that have
endured the winter; the second, naked buds formed in the spring and developing very
soon after their formation. The branches arising from these latter finally give birth
to scaly buds, which sleep through the winter and reproduce the same order of things
the following year.
</p>
<p>“Both axillary and terminal buds are in the normal order of plant-life: they appear
in all forms of vegetation that live several years. But when the plant is in danger,
when by some accident the regular buds are lacking or insufficient, others spring
into being here and there at haphazard, even on the root if necessary, to restore
a languishing vitality and put the plant once more in a flourishing condition. These
accidental buds are to the part of the plant above the ground what adventitious roots
are to the part below the ground: the menace of the moment calls them into existence
at any endangered point. The edges of the wound caused by the lopping off of a branch,
the part of a tree-trunk constricted by a band, portions of the bark injured by contusion,
these are the points where they appear by preference. They are called adventitious
buds, but their structure does not differ from that of normal buds.
</p>
<p>“Adventitious buds lend themselves to valuable uses. Suppose a number of young saplings
to be planted at proper intervals in the ground. If they are then left to themselves
these saplings grow each into a single trunk and form collectively a wood or forest.
But it may be of advantage to replace each <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>of these single trunks by a group of several trunks. In that case the young plantation
is cut down to the level of the ground, and around the edge of each cross-section
there presently spring a number of adventitious buds which shoot up into an equal
number of stems, so that each sapling that would have developed only one trunk is
transformed into a stump from which start numerous sprouts or suckers, all of the
same age and strength. Then instead of a wood or forest we have a growth of underbrush,
or a copse. When the suckers have acquired the desired size, a fresh cutting back
lays them low and induces a still denser growth of shoots by multiplying the number
of wounds. It is thus that from a single stock, repeatedly cut back and as often reinvigorated
by the growth of adventitious buds, a quantity of wood is obtained exceeding that
produced by the free and solitary development of one tree.
</p>
<p>“Spared by the axe, the poplar rises in a majestic obelisk of verdure. The willow,
so ungraceful in appearance along the banks of our ditches, with its shapeless top
bristling with shoots sticking out in all directions, is, in its natural state, a
tree of rare elegance on account of the suppleness of its branches and the fineness
of its foliage. Considered as a thing of beauty, it certainly has nothing to gain
by man’s interference with its mode of growth. But, alas, productivity does not always
go hand in hand with beauty; and if it is desired to make these two trees, the poplar
and the willow, produce a great <span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>mass of branches and fire-wood, decapitation, repeated periodically, transforms them
into pollards, seamed with scars, gaping with bleeding wounds, disfigured with bruises,
but at the same time contending against all this hard usage by a never-failing growth
of adventitious buds which constantly replace with increasing prodigality the brushwood
that has fallen victim to the axe.
</p>
<p>“To finish the subject of adventitious buds—buds that persist in multiplying even
when the parent stock languishes, and that withstand destruction until utter exhaustion
has set in—let us recall for a moment certain weeds such as dog’s-tooth grass, cock-spur
grass, and other grasses that are so hard to keep out of our garden paths unless we
do something more than merely rake the surface of the ground. You may have taken infinite
pains, we will say, to clean the paths, and have left them immaculate, or at least
you think so. But you are mistaken. In a few days the grass has all come back in richer
tufts than ever. The reason is plain enough now: your raking simply cut back the stems,
leaving wounds that immediately covered themselves with adventitious buds, which quickly
sent up new stalks. Thus, instead of destroying, you have multiplied. The only way
to clear the ground of weeds is to pull them up by the roots; that done, you may consider
the job well done.”

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">BULBS AND BULBLETS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“After attaining the requisite degree of strength the buds of certain plants leave
the parent stalk and, if we may so express it, emigrate; that is to say, they detach
themselves and take root in the earth, to draw nourishment directly therefrom. Now
it is evident that a bud designed for independent development cannot have precisely
the structure of one destined never to leave the parent stem. To satisfy its first
needs before roots capable of nourishing it have been sent down into the soil, it
must of necessity have a certain prepared store of nutriment. Therefore every bud
that emigrates carries a supply of food with it.
</p>
<p>“There is cultivated in gardens a pretty little lily native to high mountains, bearing
orange-colored blossoms, and known as the bulbiferous lily. Here is a piece of the
stalk with its buds situated in the axils of the leaves. These buds must pass through
the winter and develop the following spring. They are covered with succulent scales,
very thick, tender, and fleshy, good for nourishment as well as for protection. This
store of provisions makes the bud quite plump. Toward the end of summer some of these
buds leave the mother plant; they fall at the <span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>slightest wind, scatter on the ground, and are henceforth given over to their own
resources. If the season is a wet one, many of them, still in place at the axils of
the leaves, send out one or two little roots that hang in the air as if trying to
reach the ground. Before October arrives all the buds have fallen. Then the mother
stalk dies. Soon the autumn winds and rains cover the scattered buds with dead leaves
and mold. Under this shelter they swell all winter from the juices of their scales,
plunge their roots into the ground little by little, and, behold, in the spring each
one displays its first green leaf, continues henceforth its independent growth, and
finally becomes a plant like the original lily.
</p>
<p>“The fleshy, scaly buds destined to develop independently of the mother stalk are
called bulblets. No plant known to agriculture could furnish us so striking an example
of bud-emigration as the bulbiferous lily; but in our kitchen gardens we have garlic,
which acts in almost the same way. Take a whole head of garlic. On the outside are
dry, white wrappings. Strip these off and underneath you will find large buds which
can easily be detached one by one. Then come more white wrappings followed by new
buds, so that the entire head is a package of alternate wrappings and buds.
</p>
<p>“These wrappings are the dried-up lower portions of the old leaves of the plant, leaves
blanched where the soil covered them, and where they still remain, and formerly green
where exposed to the air, though that part is now lacking. In the axils of these leaves
<span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>buds have formed according to the general rule; only, as they are destined to develop
by themselves, they have stored up supplies in their thickened scales, and that is
what makes them unusually large. Split one of them lengthwise. Under a tough sheath
you will find an enormous fleshy mass forming almost the whole of the bud. That is
the storehouse. With such supplies of food the bud is well able to take care of itself.
And, in fact, when a market-gardener wishes to raise a crop of garlic, he does not
have recourse to the seed; that would take too long. He turns his attention to the
buds; that is to say, he plants in the ground, one by one, the bulblets of which the
heads of garlic are composed. Each of these bulblets, sustained at first by its own
reserves of food, puts forth roots and leaves and becomes a complete garlic plant.

<p>“From the bulblet to the bulb, from garlic to an onion, there is but a single step.
Let us split an onion in two from top to bottom. We shall find it composed of a succession
of fleshy scales compactly fitted together. In the heart of this cluster of succulent
scales, which are nothing but leaves so modified as to form a food-storehouse, are
found other leaves of normal shape and green color. An onion, then, is a bud provisioned
for an independent life by the conversion of its outside leaves into fleshy scales;
and it is called a bulb, not a bulblet, because of its size, the latter <span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>term being the diminutive form of ‘bulb.’ Bulb and bulblet differ merely in size:
the bulb is larger, the bulblet smaller, and that is all.
</p>
<p>“Every one has noticed that an onion hanging on the wall ready at hand for the cook,
is awakened to life in the course of the winter by the heat of the room, and from
within its envelope of red scales puts forth a beautiful green shoot that seems to
protest against the rigors of the season and reminds us of the sweet pleasures of
spring. As it develops, its fleshy scales wrinkle, soften, become flabby, and finally
fall off in decay to serve as fertilizer for the young plant. Sooner or later, however,
its store of provision being exhausted, the shoot perishes unless placed in earth.
There we have a striking example of a bud that develops independently by means of
its own accumulated supplies. The leek is also a bulb, but very slender in shape.
Like the onion, it consists of a cluster of lower leaf-parts sheathed one inside another.
Among ornamental plants having bulbs are the lily, the tulip, and the hyacinth.”

<h2 class="main">TUBERS—STARCH</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“There are buds that, though called to an independent existence, do not, before separating
from the mother plant, store up provisions nor thicken their scales; but the plant
itself is charged with feeding them. When it is intended that the stem or branch shall
itself maintain the buds it bears, then, instead of coming out into the open air where
it would speedily cover itself with foliage and flowers, it remains underground and
has for leaves only rudimentary scales. It grows so corpulent and deformed as to cease
to bear the name of branch and to take instead that of tuber. As soon as necessary
supplies have been stored up, the tuber detaches itself from the mother plant, and
thenceforth the buds it bears find in it abundant nourishment for their separate existence.
A tuber, then, is an underground branch swollen with nutritive material and having
undeveloped scales in place of leaves, and it is also dotted here and there with buds
which it must feed.
</p>
<p>“Let us now look at a potato. What do we see on the surface? Certain small cavities
or eyes; that is to say, so many buds, for these eyes develop into <span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>branches if the potato is placed in favorable conditions. On old potatoes, late in
the season, the buds are seen to send forth sprouts which need only a little sunshine
to turn green and become stalks. Agriculture makes good use of this peculiarity: to
propagate the plant it is customary to put into the ground, not the seeds, which would
yield no harvest before the lapse of several years, but the tubers, which produce
abundantly the same year. Or else the potato is cut into pieces and each piece, planted
in the ground, sends up a new plant on condition that it has at least one eye; if
it has none it rots without producing anything.
</p>
<p>“Furthermore, you can see on the eyes tiny little scales, which are leaves modified
to adapt them to an underground life, leaves with the same right to the name as the
tough scales of an ordinary bud. Since it has leaves and buds the potato is therefore
a branch. Should there remain any lingering doubts on this subject, it might be added
that by earthing up the plant, that is to say by heaping soil around the stalk, the
young branches thus buried can be converted into potato-bearers; and it might also
be added that in rainy and cloudy seasons it is not rare to see some of the ordinary
branches thicken and swell up in the open air, and thus produce potatoes more or less
perfect. Accordingly the potato is to be regarded as an underground branch swollen
with nourishment—in short, a tuber.
</p>
<p>“Many other plants produce similar branches that grow under ground. In this number
is the Jerusalem <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>artichoke, the tubers of which have buds arranged two by two on opposite swellings,
from front to back and from right to left in turn, exactly as are leaves and buds
on the stem.
</p>
<p>“The potato feeds it buds on a farinaceous substance called fecula or, in less learned
language, starch. It is the very material that makes the vegetable so rich in nutriment
for us. We turn to our own account what the plant has stored up for its young shoots.
Starch is contained in the extremely small cavities with which the flesh of the tuber
is all riddled. These cavities are called cells. They are microscopic sacs made of
a fine membrane and having no opening. Crammed full of starch grains and crowded one
against another, they compose the fleshy substance of the potato. But these cavities
are so small that a person would strain his eyes in vain in any attempt to see them
in the cross-section of a potato. A magnifying glass is necessary. So minute are the
cells that in a piece of potato no larger than a pin’s head there is room for dozens
and dozens of them. This picture shows you, but much larger than in nature, a potato
cell with the grains of starch it encloses.”
</p>
<div class="figure floatRight p095width"><img src="images/p095.png" alt="Starch Grains of Potato" width="100" height="143"><p class="figureHead">Starch Grains of Potato</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“How beautifully,” exclaimed Emile, “those grains of starch are arranged in their
little cubby-hole! They might be taken for a nest of eggs. And you say there are heaps
and heaps of these little starch cells?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Yes, my boy; in a medium-sized potato they could be counted by millions and millions.”
</p>
<p>“It must be rather a curious sight to look at a little piece of potato through a powerful
magnifying-glass.”
</p>
<p>“It is indeed one of the most curious sights, this countless multitude of starch grains,
all the same shape, all white as snow, gathered together by tens, dozens, scores,
and even more, in their delicate little box-like cells.
</p>
<p>“Let us perform an experiment not beyond our means; let us remove the starch from
a potato. All we need to do is to tear open the cells in order to liberate the starch
grains, and then filter them out. Watch me do it. With a kitchen grater I reduce the
potato to pulp and thus tear the cells open. Now I put the pulp on a piece of linen
over a large glass and pour a little water through it with one hand while with the
other I keep stirring the pulp. The grains of starch from the ruptured cells are washed
away by the water and carried through the meshes of the fabric, while the remnants
of the cell-walls, being too large to pass through, stay behind in the filter.
</p>
<p>“Thus I obtain a glassful of turbid water. Look at it under a bright sun. In the water
a multitude of white satiny specks are falling like so much snow and piling up on
the bottom. In a few moments the deposit has settled. I then throw away the clear
water above it and have left a powdery substance, magnificently white, which if pressed
between the <span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>fingers creaks like fine sand. It is the starch of the potato, and is made up of such
fine grains that it would take from one hundred and fifty to two hundred to equal
the head of a pin in size. Nevertheless these grains, minute though they are, have
a very complicated structure, each one of them being composed of a large number of
tiny leaflets folded one over another. The picture I showed you just now will serve
to give you an idea of these superposed leaflets that go to make, all together, a
single grain. Now if some of this starch is boiled in a little water, the successive
leaflets of the grain open and separate, and the whole becomes an unctuous jelly far
exceeding in volume that of the starch used.”
</p>
<p>To prove this assertion, Uncle Paul proceeded to heat in a little water the starch
taken from the potato, and soon the powdery matter was reduced to a beautiful pellucid
jelly.

<h2 class="main">USES OF STARCH</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“That jelly,” remarked Jules, “looks just like the paste that I make with laundry
starch. Your potato starch there in the bottom of the glass has exactly the same appearance
as starch dissolved in cold water for ironing clothes.”
</p>
<p>“That close resemblance,” replied his uncle, “is explained by the fact that potato
starch and laundry starch are at bottom the same thing. Both substances are chemically
known as fecula; but laundry starch is made from cereals, particularly wheat, while
fecula, properly speaking, comes either from potatoes or from various grains and roots.
</p>
<p>“Like the starch of the potato, laundry starch is in the form of superposed leaflets,
but its grains are much smaller: ten thousand would hardly be enough to make a pellet
the size of a pin’s head. And there are some still smaller. It would take sixty-four
thousand grains of Indian corn starch to make a pin’s head or, to be more exact, to
fill the inside of a cube measuring one millimeter on a side; and in the case of the
beet it would take ten millions. You see that in spite of their excessive smallness,
a smallness that makes them invisible to the naked eye, the starch grains of the potato
are giants in comparison.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p>“It is chiefly by the varying size of their microscopic grains that the starches of
different kinds are distinguished from one another. In substance and structure they
are all alike. Placed in warm water, their grains swell, burst, expand their leaflets,
and the starch, from whatever source, is changed into a glutinous jelly.
</p>
<p>“Starch is the food supply of plant-life. Wherever we find buds that are intended
to develop by themselves, wherever we find germs, there also we shall find a supply
of starch serving as a sort of food reserve. Hence this peculiar provision is met
with in tubers, bulbs, bulblets, seeds, and fleshy roots. Now when these buds and
germs develop, the starch becomes, in the process of vegetation, a kind of sugar which,
being soluble in water, can be sent to all parts of the young plant and serve it for
food.
</p>
<p>“By certain artificial devices this same change of starch into sugar can be brought
about. The simplest of these devices is the application of heat, which always enters
into the preparation of farinaceous food. Let us take a few examples. A raw potato
is uneatable. Boiled in water or roasted in the ashes, it is excellent. What has happened,
then? Heat has converted a part of the starch into sugar, and the tuber has become
a sugary farinaceous paste. The same can be said of the chestnut. Raw, it is no great
delicacy, although at a pinch it can be eaten; cooked, it is worthy of all the praise
we can give it. I appeal to you to back me up in this assertion. Here, then, we have
another transformation of starch <span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>into sugar by the action of heat. Beans, peas, both as hard as bullets in the dry
state and of no agreeable flavor, are unmistakably sweetened by being boiled in water
and having their starch acted on by heat. Our various farinaceous foods behave in
the same way. Ingenuity brings into play a more powerful agent than heat alone to
convert the starch into sugar. It is boiled in water and during the boiling a little
sulphuric acid or oil of vitriol is added. Under the influence of this energetic fluid
the starch is changed into a sugary syrup. It is of course to be understood that this
syrup, as soon as it has been thus produced, is separated from the oil of vitriol
which has served to make it.
</p>
<p>“The sugar thus obtained is a soft, sticky substance, and almost as sweet as honey,
but very different from ordinary sugar, which is solid and comes in beautiful white
loaves.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1419src" href="#xd31e1419">1</a> It is called starch-sugar or glucose. Confectioners use it a great deal. When you
crunch a sugar-plum—and I am persuaded that you do not underestimate the excellence
of sugar-plums—do you know what you are eating? A composition of starch and starch-sugar.
I pass over the almond in the center; that is beside the question.”
</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say,” demanded Jules, “that a bag of sugar-plums comes from such stuff
as potatoes and oil of vitriol?”
</p>
<p>“Such is undoubtedly the origin of the delicious sugar-plum,” was the reply; “and
indeed many of <span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>the delicacies of the pastry-cook, of the confectioner, and of the manufacturer of
refreshing beverages, which you believe to be sweetened with ordinary sugar, really
owe their sweet taste to syrup made from starch—a much cheaper product than sugar.
You see the potato furnishes something else besides the modest dishes with which it
supplies our table.
</p>
<p>“Nor is that the whole story. Starch-sugar, or glucose, is exactly the same as the
sugar of ripe grapes. With potato-flour, water, and a few drops of oil of vitriol
there is artificially produced, in enormous boilers, the same sugary substance that
the vine produces in its bunches of grapes with the help of the sun’s rays. Now grape
sugar turns to alcohol by fermenting. Glucose must undergo a similar change. And,
as a matter of fact, in northern countries too cold to admit of the cultivation of
the vine, alcoholic liquors are made from starch previously changed into sugar. On
account of their origin these liquors go under the general name of potato-brandy.
All seeds and roots rich in starch can be used in similar manufacture.
</p>
<p>“Beer is a product of this sort. First barley is made to germinate by being kept moist
and warm. In the process of germination the starch is changed into glucose for the
nourishment of the young shoots. When the little plants begin to develop, the grain
is dried and ground to flour. This mixed with water furnishes a sugary liquid which
ferments, turning partly to alcohol and finally becoming beer.”

<h2 class="main">HISTORY OF THE POTATO</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Next to wheat no plant in our part of the world is of so much importance for food
as the potato. Its use was not introduced into this country until toward the end of
the eighteenth century. The first appearance of the potato among our people is a curious
piece of history. Why should I not relate it to you? It will show you what noble efforts
and perseverance are sometimes necessary to bring about the adoption, on the part
of those wedded to blind routine, of the simplest, most natural idea, and one so rich
in future possibilities.
</p>
<p>“The potato is native to South America; it came to us from the high plains of Colombia,
Chile, and Peru. Its first appearance in Europe dates from 1565. A century and a half
later the potato flourished in England. Its introduction into general use in France
was slower. The first dish of potatoes, then a high-priced rarity, was served at the
table of King Louis XIII in 1616.
</p>
<p>“The royal dish is to-day at the command of the poorest; but this was not effected
without a good deal of trouble, as you will see. For a long time the American tuber
remained in our country a simple object of curiosity to which were attributed injurious
<span class="pageNum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>properties, and which agriculture would have nothing to do with. Finally, toward the
end of the eighteenth century a worthy man succeeded in overcoming these prejudices
and popularized the culture of this valuable food plant. His name is Parmentier. Remember
this venerated name, my friends; he who bore it banished famine by making the potato
supply the deficiency of wheat.
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p103width"><img src="images/p103.png" alt="Potato" width="81" height="150"><p class="figureHead">Potato</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“Parmentier communicated his ideas to Louis XVI. ‘The potato,’ said he, ‘is bread
already made and requiring neither miller nor baker. Take it just as it comes out
of the ground and bake it in hot ashes or cook it in boiling water, and you will have
a farinaceous food rivaling wheat. Poor land unfit for other crops will raise it,
and it will henceforth relieve us of all fear of those terrible dearths that France
has so often suffered in the past.’
</p>
<p>“Louis XVI listened to this proposal with eager attention, but the difficulty was
to make others listen also. In order to interest the world of fashion in the culture
of the disdained tuber the king appeared at a public festival one day with a large
bouquet of potato blossoms in his hand. Curiosity was aroused at the sight of these
white flowers tinged with violet and set off by the dark green of the leaves. They
were talked of at court and in town; florists made imitations of them for their artificial
bouquets; in ornamental gardens they were used for the borders; and as the surest
way to royal favor the nobles sent <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>potatoes to their tenant farmers with orders to plant and cultivate them.”
</p>
<p>“Behold the potato fairly started on the right road!” interposed Jules. “It cannot
fail to become popular now, under the protection of king and court.”
</p>
<p>“Not so fast, my little friend. Persuasion is a good deal better than command. The
tubers patronized by royalty were thrown on the dunghill. At most, here and there
a farmer, afraid of being reprimanded, allowed them to grow as best they could in
some neglected corner.”
</p>
<p>“And then?”
</p>
<p>“Then the only thing to do was to convince, not the nobleman who cared nothing for
the potato except as a means for winning the king’s favor, but the peasant himself
directly interested in this affair. It was necessary to overcome his repugnance, a
repugnance that made him reject the potato even as fodder for cattle; he must be taught
by his own experience that the tuber of ill repute, far from being a poison, is excellent
food. All this Parmentier thoroughly understood and he set to work without delay.”
</p>
<p>“This time he is sure to succeed.”
</p>
<p>“Not at first and not without great pains. In the suburbs of Paris he bought or rented
for farming large tracts of land which he caused to be planted with potatoes. The
first year the harvest was sold at a very low price. A few people bought some.”
</p>
<p>“Now we are nearing the goal.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Not yet. Good is not accomplished so easily. The second year the potatoes were given
away for nothing. Nobody wanted them.”
</p>
<p>“And Parmentier was left with the whole crop on his hands?”
</p>
<p>“The excellent man could not find a welcome for a single basket of potatoes. In the
country they laughed maliciously at his obstinacy in cultivating a vile root that
no peasant would even feed to his pigs. But Parmentier did not despair. A singular
idea came to him: to see whether the charm of forbidden fruit would not accomplish
what he had failed to effect by his writings, his advice, his personal example, and
his generous offers.
</p>
<p>“A large field was planted with potatoes, and when the crop was ripe a fence was built
about the field as if to protect a most valuable harvest. And more than this, Parmentier
caused it to be trumpeted abroad throughout the neighboring villages that it was expressly
forbidden to touch the potatoes under penalty of all the rigors of the law against
marauders. During the day the guards kept strict watch over the field, and woe betide
whoever should try to climb over the fence!”
</p>
<p>“It seems to me,” said Emile, “that with all those prohibitions and guards and fences
Parmentier was more likely than ever to have all his potatoes to himself.”
</p>
<p>“Such was not his purpose; far from it. The guards kept good watch during the day,
but they had orders to stay at home at night and leave unmolested <span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>any who might attempt to get into the field. ‘What, then, is this plant that is guarded
with such jealous care?’ the peasants asked one another, attracted by the strictness
of the prohibitory measures. ‘It must be very precious. Let us try to get some when
the night is dark.’
</p>
<p>“Some bold <span class="corr" id="xd31e1472" title="Source: maurauders">marauders</span> climbed the fence, hastily pulled up a dozen tubers, and scampered off again, looking
back to make sure they were not pursued. Not a guard was to be seen. Word soon spread
that the field was not guarded at night. Then the pillage began in earnest: the tubers
hitherto so despised were carried off by sackfuls. In a few days there was not a potato
left in the ground.
</p>
<p>“People came and told Parmentier of the devastation of his field. The worthy man wept
for joy; the one robbed blessed his robbers. By his ruse he had endowed his country
with an inestimable food-supply; for, once placed in the hands of those who would
consent to cultivate it, the potato was valued at its true worth and spread rapidly.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, what a curious story!” cried Louis, when Uncle Paul had finished; “what a curious
story! Who would have thought it took all that trouble to make people accept a food
that to-day is of such value to us? Is it, then, so very hard to spread a good idea
when it is new?”
</p>
<p>“Very hard indeed,” replied Uncle Paul, “as those well know who make it their mission
to fight against prejudice and ignorance.”

<h2 class="main">ASCENDING SAP</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Now let us see how the plant is nourished by the various substances of which we have
just studied the most important. Every form of plant-life is made up, not of a compact
and uniform mass of matter with no occasional empty spaces, but, on the contrary,
with the aid of a microscope it is seen that an infinite number of very minute cavities
called cells are interspersed throughout the body of the plant. These cells may be
regarded as extremely small closed sacs, sometimes round, sometimes oval, but more
often with irregular and angular outlines by reason of the mutual pressure exerted
by the cells. The cell-wall is composed of an excessively fine membrane. In the pith
of the elder, all riddled like a sponge, you have an example of cells large enough
to be seen without a microscope. Other cavities are long, pointed at both ends and
swollen in the middle like a spindle. They are called fibers. Still others form canals
of uniform size throughout, as fine as a hair and long enough to extend from the roots
to the topmost leaves. These canals are called ducts. Look closely at the cross-section
of a very dry vine-branch, and you will see a multitude of orifices into which it
would be possible to thrust a <span class="pageNum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>hair. Those are the openings into so many broken ducts. Everything in the plant, absolutely
everything—root, stalk, wood, bark, leaves, flowers, fruit, seeds, no matter what—is
composed of a mass of cells, fibers, and ducts.
</p>
<p>“That understood, let us consider the root of the plant. In its new parts, at the
tip-ends of its finest ramifications, tip-ends that we have called spongioles, it
is composed of cells just formed and consequently tender and fitted for absorbing
easily the moisture in the soil. Spongioles, then, fill themselves much as sponges
would do. That done, conduits offer their services for conveying the liquid to the
top of the plant: they are the ducts just referred to, and comparable here to the
water-pipes in our own fountains. But if in fountains water runs by its own weight,
going from the highest to the lowest point, it is not so with the liquid absorbed
by the roots, a liquid running from below upward. What then is the force that makes
it ascend?
</p>
<p>“This force is in the buds or, to speak more correctly, in the leaves. Each leaf is
the seat of an active evaporation whose object is to rid the plant of the great quantity
of water required for dissolving in the soil and then conveying to the leaves the
nutritive substances present in the soil. This evaporation leaves a void in the cells
that have given up the evaporated water. But this void is immediately filled from
the neighboring cells, which give up their contents and receive in turn the contents
of the next lower layers. From cell to cell, from <span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>fiber to fiber, from duct to duct, a similar transfer takes place at points farther
and farther away from the evaporating surface, until the tip-ends of the rootlets
are reached, where a continuous absorption makes good the loss of moisture by evaporation.
The process reminds one somewhat of the working of our pumps, in which the piston
leaves behind it a void that is immediately filled by the water in the pipe, which
in its turn gets water from the bottom of the well. This liquid which ascends in every
plant, absorbed by the spongioles of the rootlets and put in motion by the evaporation
from the leaves, is called ascending sap, or crude sap. The sap is called ascending
because it passes from below upward, from the roots to the branches; and it is called
crude because it has not yet undergone the preparation that will turn it into the
nutritive liquid of the plant. Thus we have learned our first lesson, namely: ascending
sap is carried especially to those parts of the plant where buds are numerous, where
leaves abound; it seeks by preference the ends of the branches, where evaporation
is most active.
</p>
<p>“We know that the surface wood is the newest; it is formed of cells, fibers, and ducts
whose cavities are free and whose walls are permeable. The interior wood is older;
its cells, fibers, and ducts are encrusted, stopped up, decrepit, out of use. The
liquid accordingly makes its way where circulation is possible, and ceases to flow
where the passage is obstructed. That is to say, the ascent of the sap takes place
through the sap-wood and chiefly through <span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>the outermost layers, or those of most recent formation. Repeated experiment leaves
no doubt on this point. When a tree is cut down at the time of the sap’s greatest
activity, we find the sap-wood moist and the older wood perfectly dry. Finally, in
herbaceous plants the sap ascends through the whole body of the stem. Suspended during
the winter on account of the absence of foliage, this ascent of the sap becomes remarkably
brisk at the awakening of vegetation. Then it is that fruit-trees shed tears, so to
speak, where the pruning-hook has left its mark; or, in other words, the ascending
sap oozes from the openings of the severed ducts. These tears are especially noticeable
in the grape-vine, where it has recently been trimmed.
</p>
<p>“Now what would you expect to find in this liquid if you collected some of it as it
trickles in the form of tears either from the vine or from a fruit-tree? Many things,
doubtless, you will say, since this precious liquid is the prime source of all that
the plant contains in itself. If such is your thought, undeceive yourselves: ascending
sap is little more than clear water, and often it is very difficult for science to
prove beyond a doubt the presence in it of various substances in solution, so minute
a fraction of the whole do they compose. Among these substances the most frequent
are compounds of potash, of lime, of carbonic acid gas, traces of phosphates, and
compounds of nitrogen or ammonia. In short, the liquid from which the plant is to
derive its nourishment is the weakest sort of broth, composed of an enormous <span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>quantity of water and a very small proportion of dissolved substances. These inconsiderable
substances are the only or almost the only things utilized by the plant; and the water
that has collected them in filtering through the soil, and has then carried them from
the roots to the leaves through the sap-wood, the water that forms almost the whole
of the ascending sap, is destined, as soon as the journey is accomplished, to leave
the plant and return as vapor to the atmosphere whence it descended in the form of
rain.”

<h2 class="main">DESCENDING SAP</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Ascending sap, a liquid composed of a large quantity of water and a very small proportion
of dissolved nutritive substances, is absorbed in the ground by the roots and carried
to the leaves through the sap-wood. It is not yet a nutritive fluid for the plant;
it becomes so in the foliage by a double process. First, on being distributed to the
leaves, which furnish a vast surface for evaporation, it exhales its superabundant
water in the form of vapor and thus concentrates its usable ingredients. Then, under
the influence of the sun’s rays and through the medium of the green matter contained
in the leaves, it undergoes modifications that work a fundamental change in its character.
Among the processes here taking place, one of the best known is the decomposition
of the carbonic acid gas taken from the air by the leaves and from the soil by the
roots.
</p>
<p>“We have seen that this gas, the plant’s chief source of nourishment, is composed
of carbon combined with the breathable part of the air, or oxygen. Under the action
of the sun’s light the leaves decompose this gas, liberating the oxygen in a condition
henceforth fit for the respiration of animals and for combustion, while the carbon
remains in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span>plant, mixes with the substances brought by the ascending sap, and with them becomes
the nourishing liquid, the descending or elaborated sap, from which all future parts
of the plant are to be formed. This liquid cannot be called wood, bark, leaf, flower,
or fruit; it is not at all like any of these, and yet it is essentially a little of
them all. An animal’s blood is neither flesh, bone, nor fleece; but bone, flesh, and
fleece are of its substance. Likewise the elaborated sap is a liquid designed for
the sustenance of all parts of the plant; it contains matter for fruit and wood, leaves
and flowers, bark and buds. It is the plant’s blood; everything in the plant gets
from it its nourishment, its wherewithal to develop. What a wonderful, what an incomprehensible
process its production appears to us! In the crowded ranks of the leaf-cells, where
one would suppose everything to be at rest, what activity, what transformations beyond
the reach of human science! Liquids swell the cells, ooze from one to another, transpire,
infiltrate, circulate, exchange their dissolved substances; vapors are exhaled, gases
come, others go; the sun’s light separates what was united, unites what was separated,
and the raw materials of the ascending sap combine henceforth with the materials of
life.
</p>
<p>“The elaborated sap descends from the leaves to the twigs, from the twigs to the branches,
from the branches to the stalk or trunk, and from the latter to the root, distributing
itself here and there on its way. It circulates between the wood and the bark. <span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>It is this sap that, in the spring, when it is in great abundance, forms between the
wood and the bark a thin layer of slightly viscous moisture and makes the bark easy
to peel from its branch. Which of you in the month of May has not taken advantage
of this peculiarity to peel off all in one piece a tube of bark from a very smooth
twig of willow or lilac in order to make a whistle, trumpet, or other noisy plaything,
the delight of boys of your age?
</p>
<p>“Nothing is easier than to prove the passage of sap from above downward. If you remove
from a tree-trunk an annular band of bark, the nourishing liquid oozes and accumulates
at the upper edge of the wound, but nothing of the sort takes place at the lower edge.
Arrested thus by a break in its path, the sap accumulates above the uncovered ring
and causes there an abundant growth of wood and bark, which piles up in the form of
a thick circular swelling, while below the ring the trunk preserves its former size.
</p>
<p>“A tight ligature, by compressing and obstructing the passages through which the nutritive
fluid has to pass, causes the formation of a similar swelling above the line of stoppage.
You may have seen a sapling, bound too tightly to the stake intended for its support,
strangled by its own growth if the gardener has forgotten to loose the band in time.
Little by little the trunk swells above this band, which is finally overgrown by the
bark and even hidden within its substance. Indeed, it is not rare to find a tree with
its trunk caught fast in a narrow <span class="pageNum" id="pb115">[<a href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>passage, as for example in the crevice of a rock, and swollen above the obstacle into
an unsightly excrescence. The stoppage of the sap in its downward course explains
this phenomenon.
</p>
<p>“If the tree-trunk is not completely encircled by the stricture, if somewhere there
is a strip of bark left free to serve as a passage, the nourishing juice takes this
way to get around the obstacle, and so pursues its course to the roots. Then the tree
continues to live. But if the barrier is absolutely insuperable, as in the case of
an unyielding ligature or when the tree has been girdled, the sap cannot descend to
the roots to nourish them; and with the death of these the end of the tree is not
far distant.
</p>
<p>“An important lesson remains to be drawn from these details concerning the circulation
of this nutritive liquid in plants. Henceforth, when we fasten a plant to its prop
or supporting stake, we shall be careful not to tie the string too tight or else to
loosen it at the proper time, since otherwise we should run the risk of strangling
the plant and so causing its death.”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Self-preservation is the first law of a tree’s life, and next to that the preservation
of its species, which is to be perpetuated by means of seeds. All this is perfectly
natural, for no posterity would be possible to the tree unless its own existence were
maintained in the first place. Accordingly the tree lives first for itself, accomplishing
this object by covering itself with buds that develop into branches covered with leaves.
It is indeed on the leaves that the fundamental principles of the plant’s life are
based; it is in their substance that, with the sun’s help, the descending sap is elaborated,
this sap being the nutritive fluid, the life-blood as it were, of the vegetable organism.
The propagation of the species comes next in importance. This duty devolves on the
flower-buds or those that blossom and produce fruit, in the center of which are the
seeds.
</p>
<p>“Thus, left to its own impulses, a tree, if vigorous and enjoying favorable conditions,
at first uses all its sap in making buds for the increase of its own woody structure;
it covers itself with stout branches and abundant foliage before making up its mind
to blossom. Later, when its limbs are strong and the <span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>ardor of growth begins to abate, the flower-buds appear, but usually in small numbers
because a prodigal production of fruit causes rapid decline. Copious blossoming comes
only toward the latter part of life; a tree never blossoms better than when it is
about to die, as if, foreseeing its end, it strove before succumbing to leave behind
it a numerous progeny. A thriving tree blossoms little or not at all; a sickly tree
makes haste to blossom. But it is to man’s interest that a tree should blossom and
bear fruit as early and as abundantly as possible; we demand from it not the branches
it would give us without our intervention, but baskets of fruit induced by our care.
From this struggle between the natural tendencies of the tree and our own needs has
sprung the practice of pruning, or the art of manipulating fruit-trees so as to obtain
from them an abundant harvest.
</p>
<p>“Here let us examine the general principles that are to guide us in the practice of
this art. The shape to be given the tree’s superstructure of branches and foliage
is the first question we must consider. This shape is far from being unimportant;
it is, on the contrary, very important, since the circulation of the sap and the distribution
of the sun’s rays, essential conditions to plant-life, are strictly dependent on it.
If the tree is left free to develop by itself and to take its natural form, the sap
from the roots will, under the impetus of its ascent, always seek by preference the
highest points, where growth will in consequence proceed with vigor, <span class="pageNum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>while the lower parts will languish and die out for want of sufficient nourishment.
If the branches are not properly thinned the central ones, deprived of the sun’s vivifying
rays, will remain poor, puny, more or less blanched. On the other hand, the tree ought
to fill, as far as possible, the place assigned it, in order that there may be no
unproductive space.
</p>
<p>“These conditions prescribe the tree’s shape. First of all, it should be symmetrical,
in order that the distribution of nourishment may be even and no part of the tree
be gorged with sap while another part is deprived of it. Secondly, the sun’s rays
should be allowed to penetrate everywhere so as to ripen the fruit and facilitate
in the foliage the important work of sap-elaboration. To attain these different objects
custom has fixed upon three principal shapes: the trellis, the pyramid, and the goblet.
In trellis pruning the tree spreads its branches symmetrically, right and left, against
a wall. The wall serves it as support and as shelter from the wind; it also gives
the foliage and fruit additional heat and light by reflecting the sun’s rays upon
them. When pruned to take the pyramid form, the tree has its branches so trimmed as
to decrease in length regularly from the base to the summit and to remain far enough
apart to admit the light to the center. The whole forms a sugar-loaf, a cone, into
the midst of which sun and air enter freely. It is the shape most in accord with nature.
Finally, the goblet-shaped tree has a certain number of branches of <span class="pageNum" id="pb119">[<a href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>equal vigor disposed in a circle around a central space that remains empty and thus
receives its share of sunlight without hindrance.”

<h2 class="main">PINCHING—BUD-NIPPING</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“When the desired shape has been obtained the next thing is to keep it, despite all
opposition on the part of the tree, which revolts in its own peculiar fashion; that
is, it strives to restore the natural conformation of its branches. Suppose, for example,
that a pear-tree, pruned after the manner of wall-fruit, has grown all out of symmetry
and developed one side more than the other. How shall the two halves be restored to
correct proportions? How shall the too vigorous part be weakened and the too feeble
part strengthened? Several methods offer themselves.
</p>
<p>“On the vigorous side let us cut back the branches with the pruning shears, leaving
only the base of each with a small number of buds; in other words, let us cut them
very short. On the weak side, on the contrary, let us leave the branches intact or
cut them very long, thus leaving them the greater part of their buds. What will come
of this treatment? Since abundant foliage, the active laboratory of the descending
sap and also a kind of pump that sucks up the sap and causes it to ascend from the
roots, is the prime cause of vigorous vegetation, the weak part, with its numerous
buds developed into leafy <span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>shoots, will grow stronger, while the strong part, with its small number of buds,
will become weaker. Both effects will tend to the same result: the restoration of
the desired symmetry.
</p>
<p>“With the ends of the fingers and the help of the thumb-nail, it is customary to pinch
off from the too vigorous side the tips of the young branches while they are still
tender. This operation we may call pinching. The sap that would have been used for
the development of these branches is diverted from its course and carried toward the
weak shoots, which it renews and stimulates. If the weak side itself needs pinching
to arrest shoots that impair the desired symmetry, the operation is postponed as long
as possible, while on the strong side it is carried out very early. The sap thus turned
away from the vigorous side toward the ailing one has a whole season in which to restore
the lost equilibrium.
</p>
<p>“Instead of limiting ourselves to pinching off the tips of the young shoots with our
thumb-nail, we can suppress them altogether while they are still tender. This is done
as early as possible on the strong side, only the indispensable shoots being left.
If it is necessary on the weak side, it is not done until the latest possible moment.
This operation we may style bud-nipping, since the word ‘bud,’ by which we designate
the germ of the future branch when it is still enveloped in scales, applies also for
the sake of convenience to the branch already developed but still young and tender.
It is evident that nipping off the buds from the strong part tends, <span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>even more than pinching, to promote the desired growth of the weak part. The more
branches we suppress entirely, the fewer will be left to share the sap needed by the
branches we wish to strengthen.
</p>
<p>“What turns aside the sap from the part pruned, pinched, or nipped, toward the part
left intact, is evidently the more or less complete suppression of foliage. It is
primarily the leaves that by the continual evaporation of which their surface is the
seat determine the ascent of the liquid drawn from the soil by the roots. The more
numerous these leaves are at any one point, the more abundant the flow of sap to that
point; the scarcer they are, the less the flow of sap. To diminish at any point the
number of leaves by pinching, bud-nipping, or any other means, is therefore to diminish
at the same point the flow of sap, which will go in some other direction, to the parts
that have more leaves and hence a more rapid rate of evaporation to summon the sap.
It is plain, then, that a middle course may be followed between the pinching that
partly suppresses the foliage of a young branch and the bud-nipping that suppresses
it entirely. This middle course consists in cutting a certain number of leaves from
the too vigorous shoots; and they should be cut clean without tearing, by severing
the stem and leaving its base undisturbed.
</p>
<p>“The easiest way for the sap to run from the roots to the foliage is from bottom to
top in a vertical line. Anything that interferes with this course hinders also the
upward impetus. Thus in branches <span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>with sharp elbows and abrupt bends the rush of sap is slackened just as the rate of
flow of a water-current is diminished by the windings occurring in its bed. Thus,
again, in a branch having a decided incline downward the sap moves with difficulty,
because its movement toward the extremity of this branch is in a direction contrary
to that which is natural to it. The application of this principle is evident. If we
wish to moderate a too vigorous growth of branches, we bend them toward the ground;
if we wish to stimulate a too feeble growth, we straighten up the branches until they
assume a vertical posture.
</p>
<p>“We can also turn to account the exhausting effect of fruit-bearing. The more fruitful
a branch is, the weaker it becomes, since the use of sap in fruit means so much the
less for foliage, and it is foliage that invigorates the branch. Accordingly we will
leave the greatest possible quantity of fruit on the strong part of our tree, and
suppress it on the weak part.”

<h2 class="main">MAKING FRUIT TREES BEAR</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“If one side of a tree is pruned very short and the other very long, the natural course
of the sap is to some extent diverted from the first side toward the second, which
is richer in buds and consequently in foliage. We have just seen how this principle
is utilized to check the growth of too vigorous a part in order to stimulate that
of one that is too feeble and thus redress the balance between the two. But what would
be the result if the whole tree were pruned at once?
</p>
<p>“Let us first see what takes place in a single branch. Pruned long, it preserves the
greater part of its buds, all of which call for nourishment from the sap flowing in
that direction; pruned short, it keeps only a few buds, which having the sap of the
entire branch at their disposal, will receive each a supply that is superabundant
in proportion to the fewness of the buds. For example, what twelve would ordinarily
have had for consumption, two or three will now have to themselves; and because of
this superabundance of nourishment each bud will develop much more vigorously than
it would otherwise have done. Hence if the whole tree is pruned with an unsparing
hand, all the sap drawn from the <span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>soil by the roots, having no longer a tendency to go to one side rather than the other,
will be distributed evenly; and the few buds left intact by the pruning-shears will
show a luxuriance of growth in proportion to the supply of nourishment placed at their
disposal. Thus thorough pruning applied to the whole tree has the effect of giving
it new vigor, of rejuvenating it in some measure, or, in other words, of replacing
its worn-out branches with vigorous ones. Accordingly when a tree has become exhausted
by abundant fruit-bearing, it is pruned without stint one year in order to restore
its vigor of growth.
</p>
<p>“Let us now see what we should do if we had quite the opposite end in view; that is,
if we wished to make a tree blossom and bear fruit. Here two principles will serve
us as guides. First, in the fulness of its vigor a tree puts forth long branches and
thick foliage, but does not cover itself with blossoms, bearing in fact only a few.
It is not until it has become somewhat enfeebled that it begins to flower in profusion.
Secondly, what would in the tree’s youthful strength have been a branch-producing
bud becomes in its enfeeblement a flower-bud; so that a flower may be regarded as
a branch which, instead of developing freely and covering itself with leaves, has
remained stunted, thrown back upon itself, for lack of vigor, and has exchanged its
leaves for floral organs,—sepals, petals, stamens, pistils. Weaken a tree and you
weaken the buds; such, in a word, is the prevailing principle.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span></p>
<p>“To weaken the buds individually, the pruning-shears will be plied but sparingly,
leaving the buds almost intact; then these, being many in number, will have so much
the less for each one separately, and some of them, especially toward the lower part
of the branch, will find themselves too feeble to contend with the others and therefore
will take the form of flower-buds, whereas they would have produced branches and not
flowers if a more thorough pruning had rid them of their rivals.
</p>
<p>“To weaken the tree as a whole, all that we have to do is to pinch off or cut off
with the thumb-nail the tender tips of the young branches; then we bend these branches
back so as to give them a number of crooks and turns that will impede the circulation
of the sap. Finally, the woody branches of the preceding year are broken by the hand,
sometimes wholly, sometimes half, so that the tip is left hanging down. If the tree
is not too vigorous these three methods, pinching, bending, and breaking, are generally
sufficient to make it bear.
</p>
<p>“But when we have to do with very exuberant vegetation, more energetic methods are
necessary. One of these we may call arching. The branches are all bent down so that
each forms an arch; that is, the tip-end of each is pulled down to the ground and
fastened there in any way that may be easiest. This abnormal position of the branch,
with its top downward, is contrary to the ascending movement of the sap, which consequently
flows less freely to the buds. The resulting dearth is conducive to fruit-bearing,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>and as soon as this effect is assured the branches are allowed to return to their
natural position; otherwise the tree would become exhausted.
</p>
<p>“Another method is as follows. Pruning is done very late, when the young shoots are
already some centimeters long. The sap used up in the growth of the shoots cut off
by the pruning shears is a great loss to the tree, which, being no longer able to
supply ample nourishment to the lower buds of the branches, turns them into flower-buds.
</p>
<p>“If these means do not suffice to make the tree bear fruit, there are more violent
ones which are employed only in the last extremity. Toward the end of winter, before
the sap has started, an incision some millimeters wide and deep enough to penetrate
the outer layers of wood is made all around the base of the trunk. Sap, as we know,
ascends through these exterior layers, the newest, the most permeable by liquids;
so if we partially intercept its passage it will flow less abundantly to the buds
and the weakened tree will soon begin to bear.
</p>
<p>“Still another expedient is to strike at the very source of the sap, the roots. The
foot of the tree is laid bare in the springtime, its main roots being denuded of their
covering and left thus exposed all summer to the open air and the hot sun. No longer
enjoying the coolness and darkness necessary to their office, they furnish less nourishment
to the tree, and this scarcity causes the formation of flower-buds. A still more drastic
method, but one that would kill the tree if employed imprudently, is to <span class="pageNum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>strip the roots of the refractory subject without mercy, cutting and mutilating a
certain number of them and then putting back the earth that has been removed. A diminution
in the flow of sap must necessarily result from this surgical operation. Finally,
if the tree is small enough for the purpose, it is dug up at the end of autumn, with
care to preserve the roots as far as possible, and planted again somewhere else. The
disturbance caused by this change of place suffices to make the tree blossom the next
year.”

<h2 class="main">THE SEED</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The ovary of the flower, after being fertilized by the pollen, becomes the fruit,
the apple on the apple-tree, the cherry on the cherry-tree, the walnut on the walnut-tree,
the grain of wheat in the wheat-ear, and so on for all plants. The fruit contains
seeds in greater or less number, and sometimes only one, as in the peach, plum, and
almond; often several, as in the apple and pear; while in other instances they can
be counted by hundreds and thousands, as in the melon, the pumpkin, and the poppy-head.
The natural function of the fruit is first to supply nourishment and then to protect
its seeds by means of coverings, these being sometimes fleshy, sometimes thin and
dry, sometimes hard and in the form of strong shells. In their turn the seeds have
as their task the propagating of the species. Every form of plant-life, from the giants
of the forest, the oak, beech, fir, and others, to the tiniest moss, has its beginning
in the seed. Every plant has its flowers, its fruit, and its seeds. It is in the seed
that vegetation is preserved in a thriving condition through the ages; it is by the
seed that every tree, every shrub, every blade of grass propagate their kind and leave
a numerous progeny.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Who would not like to know,” continued Uncle Paul, “something about the formation
of the seed that is sown in the ground to become either a little plant or an enormous
tree? What is inside it? How can an oak come from an acorn and a pear-tree from the
pip of a pear? I will try, my friends, to satisfy the very natural curiosity such
a mystery cannot fail to arouse in you.
</p>
<p>“Let us look at the fruit of an almond-tree. First it has an outside skin, green and
tender, which at maturity opens of its own accord, dries up, folds back, and lets
its contents out. Examining the latter, we find a shell, sometimes fragile enough
to be broken with the teeth, but at other times very hard and yielding only to the
hammer. Breaking the shell, we come to the seed. Of what use are the two parts we
have just removed? We must be very stupid if we cannot recognize in them the coverings
intended to protect the seed, the wrappings that shelter the delicate germ from cold,
heat, rain, and the teeth of animals. The outer envelope, covered with a short, velvety
down, serves as a protection against the weather; the inner one is a veritable strong-box
which we have to break between two stones before we can get at its contents. Similar
means of defense are found in all fruit, but with wide differences in the different
kinds of plants. The cherry, plum, peach, and apricot have the hard shell, the strong-box,
of the almond, and also an outer envelope of juicy flesh. The apple and pear have
their seeds or pips, as they are called, snugly <span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>ensconced in five little cavities grouped in the shape of a five-pointed star, as
may be seen in a cross-section of the fruit. These little cavities have walls of a
tough, scaly material somewhat resembling horn, while all about them is a thick rampart
of flesh. Beans and peas are arranged in a sort of long sheath that opens in two pieces.
Chestnuts are packed in a bag covered with long prickles. All these protecting coverings,
whatever their shape and character and degree of toughness, form part of the fruit.
</p>
<p>“Let us go back to the almond. The shell being broken, we come to the seed, which
is all in one piece. This seed, as we have just seen, is protected by two coverings,
the inner one of which is a very firm, hard casing called the stone. As a protection
is it enough? Not quite. Beneath the exterior defensive armor comes the fine inner
covering that wraps the seed closely and shields it from contact with the hard shell.
This covering is double and is composed on the outside of a reddish skin and inside
of an extremely thin and flexible white cuticle. Similar double clothing is found
on all seeds. The inner one is always very fine, as indeed it should be, since it
comes next to the most essential and delicate part of the seed. Do we put coarse cloth,
rough woolen stuff next to the tender flesh of a new-born babe? Certainly not; but
rather the finest of linen, and over that the woolen fabric. The plant does the same
with its tender young seeds. The outer envelope, much firmer and tougher than the
inner, looks very <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>differently in different plants. In the almond and walnut it is a reddish skin, and
so it is also in the stones of the peach, apricot, and plum. In the pips of the pear
and apple it is a tough brown casing. In beans it is smooth and shiny, sometimes quite
white, sometimes black and white, sometimes speckled with red spots. In addition,
peas and beans of all kinds have at one point on their surface a sort of little oval
eye. To this eye was once attached a small short cord that fastened the seed to the
wall of the pod and served as a pipe for supplying it with nourishment. All seeds
have this attachment, or nursing-cord, as we may call it, but not all have so clearly
marked as in the bean the eye where the cord is fastened.
</p>
<p>“After the two coverings of the seed have been removed, which is very easily done
when the almond is new, there remains a white object, firm and savory, the eatable
part of the fruit of the almond-tree. That object is the seed proper; that is to say,
the part that would have become a tree if planted in the ground. It is round at one
end and rather pointed at the other. From the pointed end projects a little nipple,
and all around the edge runs a slight furrow indicating that here the seed may be
split in two. Let us insert the point of a knife into this furrow and exert a little
pressure. One half will come away and the other half will show us what you see in
this picture.

</p>
<p>“The little pointed nipple (<i>r</i>) is called a radicle. It is the part that, if allowed to grow, would push <span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>down into the earth, send out branches there, and become the root. At the point marked
<i>g</i> is a compact bunch of tiny leaves, all white, forming a kind of bud, but one that
is much feebler and more delicate than buds that grow on branches. It is called a
gemmule. This bud will unfold and send forth the first leaves. Finally, the narrow
line of demarcation between the radicle and the gemmule is called the tigella, and
from it the trunk of the tree will take its start. Such is the almond-tree in its
seed. The large tree that will send out a mass of branches and foliage into the air
and thrust powerful roots into the ground is now contained in an insignificant corpuscle
just large enough to be seen.”

<h2 class="main">THE SEED’S FOOD-SUPPLY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“When it has leaves and roots that are sufficiently developed, the little almond-tree
will nourish itself by drawing what it needs from the earth and air. But until then
it must live, it must grow stronger, and it must increase a little in size. As nothing
can come from nothing, the germinating seed must find somewhere the material for its
first growth. This cannot be in the soil so long as the radicle is nothing but a point,
incapable of any work; neither can it be in the air so long as the little leaf-bud
has not unfolded and developed into foliage. The seed, then, must have a certain supply
of nutriment stored up within itself. Let us turn our attention to this prepared stock
of food.
</p>
<p>“In the almond we have studied the gemmule or leaf-bud, the radicle, and the tigella;
but there still remain two large pieces, easily separable from each other, and constituting
by themselves alone almost the entire bulk of the seed. These two pieces are the plant’s
first pair of leaves, but leaves of a peculiar structure, being very thick, fleshy,
and relatively enormous in size. They are the alimentary reservoirs, the storehouses
of food from which in its beginning the young plant must draw its sustenance. <span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>When germination begins, these two large leaves, swollen with nutritive matter, yield
little by little a part of their substance to the tiny plant and suckle it, as it
were. They might therefore be called vegetable udders, nursing-leaves, but science
calls them cotyledons. The unhatched chick in its shell has the yolk of the egg to
furnish substance for its growth, the young lamb has its mother’s milk, the germ of
the plant has the juice of the cotyledons.
</p>
<p>“The same structure, with two cotyledons of great size and easy to observe, may be
found in the broad bean, pea, kidney bean, and acorn, and in the stones of the peach,
apricot, and plum. It would also be found in the pips of pears and apples as well
as in the seeds of most of our cultivated plants, but more difficult to distinguish
in proportion to the smallness of the seed. In every instance the seed would be found
to have two cotyledons as food-storehouses, and also a gemmule and a radicle united
by the tigella. Other plants, on the contrary, like maize, wheat, and the other cereals,
as also the lily, tulip, and iris, have but one cotyledon, one nursing-leaf for the
new vegetable organism.
</p>
<p>“It is not always easy, especially when the seed is very small, to ascertain whether
it has two cotyledons or only one; but as soon as germination has begun, this difficulty
disappears. Then the seed with two cotyledons is seen to push up two leaves, the very
first to appear, situated opposite each other, and very often differing in shape from
those that come later. In the radish, for example, they are <span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>heart-shaped; in the carrot, long and narrow like little tongues. These two leaves
that precede the others are known as seminal leaves. They come from the two cotyledons,
which generally open in the air and grow green while nourishing the young plant with
a part of their substance; but sometimes, as in the acorn, they remain hidden underground.
On the other hand, seeds having but one cotyledon come up with only one seminal leaf,
generally narrow and long. This is what we observe if we watch the germination of
a grain of wheat.
</p>
<p>“A simpler and quicker method may be used for ascertaining how many cotyledons a seed
has. Hold a leaf up to the light and you will see its texture traversed by a multitude
of little cords which serve it as a kind of framework. These cords are called veins
or nerves. Now then, if you compare the leaf of a pear-tree with a blade of wheat,
or reed, you will see that in the former the veins are more and more subdivided and
ramified, joining one another and thus forming a network with irregular meshes, while
in the latter the veins do not branch, but run in parallel lines without forming meshes.
We should find the same difference of framework between the leaves of the elm, poplar,
and plane-tree, on the one hand, and those of the iris, narcissus, and tulip, on the
other. This difference being established, I will add that with few exceptions, of
no interest to us here, every plant with netted-veined leaves has two cotyledons in
its seed, and that every plant with parallel-veined leaves has but one. Consequently
<span class="pageNum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>it is only necessary to glance at the foliage in order to know whether the seed has
two cotyledons or only one. I will say further that pines, firs, and the other resinous
trees have as many as ten cotyledons, which show themselves as a delicate tuft of
leaves when the little plant comes out of the ground.”
</p>
<p>Uncle Paul then led the children into the garden to fix in their minds by observation
the lesson they had just learned. “Gather haphazard,” said he, “the first leaves you
come to; then examine them and tell me how many cotyledons the seed must contain.
First, here is the iris, with large blue flowers and sword-shaped leaves.”
</p>
<p>“I see,” said Jules, “veins running in regular lines side by side, without ever joining
one another. Since these veins are parallel the iris seed has only one cotyledon.”
</p>
<p>“And this blade of grass, this also that I pick from a corn-stalk?” asked his uncle.
</p>
<p>“They, too, have parallel veins, both of them; and so their seeds must have only one
cotyledon.”
</p>
<p>“And this grape-leaf, this leaf of the cherry tree?”
</p>
<p>“It’s my turn now,” Emile hastened to interpose. “The veins form a sort of lace with
very fine meshes. The grape and the cherry have two cotyledons.”
</p>
<p>“It is as easy as that, my friends. The leaf with its arrangement of veins shows us
the fundamental characteristics of the plant. It tells us whether the germ is fed
by one nursing-leaf or two, whether the young plant comes up with one seminal leaf
or two.”

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h2 class="main">GERMINATION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The germ in the heart of the seed is in a state that may be likened to deep sleep:
its life is, as it were, arrested, suspended. But under the stimulus of certain conditions
it awakens, throws off its coverings, gathers strength from its stored-up food, unfolds
its first leaves, and appears above ground. This opening of the seed is called germination.
Moisture, warmth, and air are the determining causes; without their coöperation the
seed would remain a certain length of time in good condition for sowing, after which
it would wither and lose its germinating power.
</p>
<p>“No seed germinates without the help of moisture. Water plays a multiple part. First
it soaks into the germ and the parts surrounding it, causing these to swell more than
the envelope, so that the latter, however hard a shell it may be, is burst open. Through
the cracks of this broken envelope the gemmule pushes out on one side and the radicle
on the other, and henceforth the little plant enjoys the benefit of sun and air. Germination
is more or less slow according to the degree of resistance offered by the walls of
the seed. If these are hard and stony it is only with extreme slowness that the germ
absorbs <span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>moisture and manages to burst its cell. Therefore, to shorten the period of germination
care is taken to thin the shells of excessively hard seeds by rubbing them with a
stone.
</p>
<p>“Besides the mechanical part played by water in opening the seed, it has still another
relating to nutrition. The various changes undergone by the alimentary contents of
the perisperm and the cotyledons in becoming liquefied and capable of absorption cannot
take place without the aid of water. Furthermore, this liquid is indispensable for
dissolving the nutritive ingredients, introducing them into the young plant, and distributing
them evenly throughout. It is plain, then, that if the seed remains dry it is absolutely
impossible for it to germinate, and that in order to preserve seeds the first condition
is to protect them from moisture.
</p>
<p>“With moisture there must also be warmth. As a general rule, germination proceeds
most satisfactorily when the thermometer registers between ten and twenty degrees
centigrade, our spring and autumn temperature. Outside these limits, be it above or
below, germination is retarded, ceasing altogether in extreme temperatures.
</p>
<p>“The coöperation of air is not less necessary. Seeds might have the proper temperature
and sufficient moisture, but if air were lacking germination would not follow. This
capital condition explains to us why seeds planted too deep fail to come up; why germination
is much easier in soil that is mellow and can be permeated by the air than in soil
that is <span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>compact; why delicate seeds should be covered with very little earth or even simply
sown on the surface of the moist ground; and, finally, why ground on being broken
often becomes covered with fresh vegetation from the sprouting of seeds that have
for years lain dormant in the soil, needing only to be stirred up and brought into
contact with the air in order to germinate.
</p>
<p>“Under like conditions of temperature, moisture, and air, by no means all seeds require
the same length of time for germinating. Common garden cress germinates in about two
days. Spinach, turnips, and beans take three days to come up; lettuce, four; melons
and pumpkins, five; cereals, about a week. Two years and sometimes more are needed
by the rose-bush, the hawthorn, and various stone-fruit trees. Generally seeds with
thick and hard shells are slow in germinating on account of the obstacle they oppose
to the penetration of moisture. Finally, when sown fresh, immediately after coming
to maturity, seeds germinate quicker than when old, because old seeds have to recover
by a prolonged sojourn in the ground the moisture lost through prolonged drying.
</p>
<p>“According to their kind, seeds retain for a longer or shorter period their power
of germinating; but why this vitality is more enduring in one instance and less so
in another, we cannot tell. Neither the bulk of the seed nor the character of its
outside coverings, nor the presence or absence of a perisperm, appears to decide its
longevity. Such and such a <span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>seed lives for whole years, even centuries, while another loses its germinating power
in a few months, from no cause that we can discover. Thus the seeds of the angelica
will not come up unless they are sown immediately after maturing; but beans have been
known to germinate after being kept more than a hundred years, and rye after a hundred
and forty. Excluded from the air, certain seeds may be kept for centuries, always
ready to germinate whenever favorable conditions shall present themselves. This explains
why strawberry, bluet, and camomile seeds from ancient tombs have germinated just
as new seeds would have done. Finally, rush seeds have been made to germinate that
were dug up from great depths in the Island of the Seine, the original site of Paris.
Doubtless those seeds dated from the time when Paris, under the name of Lutetia, consisted
of a few mud and reed huts on the marshy borders of the stream. But despite these
remarkable exceptions let us never forget that recent seed is preferable to old for
sowing; it comes up better and in greater abundance.
</p>
<p>“We have just seen that certain seeds are very slow in coming up, as for example the
peach, apricot, and plum, whose thick shells resist the moisture required for germination.
Put directly into the ground in the very places that the young plants are to occupy
later, these seeds would be exposed to not a few dangers during their leisurely germination.
Prolonged rains might make them rot; various marauders that are partial to them, such
as rats, field-mice, <span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>jays, magpies, and crows, might dig them up and devour them. Besides, they would occupy
for a long time, with no profit to any one, the ground in which they had been planted.
All these objections are avoided by making a preliminary planting after a method known
as stratification, from the Latin word <i>stratum</i>, meaning bed or layer. In a large, deep earthen pan, with holes in its bottom, or
in any other suitable receptacle, such as a box, a pot, or a tub, likewise pierced
with holes, it is the practice to place first a layer of small pebbles. The holes
at the bottom and this layer of pebbles are to give easy access to the air and drain
off the excess of water after each irrigation. Next comes a bed of fine sandy soil,
then a layer or stratum of seeds arranged side by side, and on top of that a second
bed of earth. On this is placed another stratum of seeds, which in its turn is covered
with earth; and so the process goes on with alternating layers of seeds and earth
until the receptacle is full. Then it is watered and placed in a cellar or a dark
shed. All that is necessary after this is to keep the contents of pan or tub sufficiently
moist by an occasional sprinkling. Enclosed thus in a small space easy to watch over,
with no danger from marauding animals, and without needlessly occupying ground that
might be used for other purposes, the seeds can now take their own time to break their
hard shells and can germinate with all the slowness natural to them.
</p>
<p>“When the shells at last crack open and the radicle appears, it is time to proceed
to the final planting. <span class="pageNum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>The half-germinated seeds are then put into the ground one by one in an open field,
each at the exact spot the young plant is to occupy.
</p>
<p>“Stratification offers still another advantage. Fruit trees as well as other trees
have a stout tap-root which bores vertically into the ground to a considerable depth
and gives a good deal of trouble if transplanting is undertaken. To alter this tap-root
into a root not growing so deep, but branching horizontally, would be decidedly advantageous.
In speaking of the root we saw what the nursery-man does to obtain this result. He
passes the sharp edge of his spade under the base of each tree-trunk so as to sever
the tap-roots of his young plantations. In stratification the method is much simpler
and success surer. With his thumb-nail the gardener nips off the tip of the tender
radicle before the final planting is done. That is all. Deprived of its growing end
the young root henceforth branches out horizontally instead of descending vertically.”

<h2 class="main">THE BLOSSOM</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Here is the fennel-flower, which, with the corn-flower and the poppy, is so common
in our fields of grain. It is purplish red, while the poppy is scarlet and the corn-flower,
or bluet, is of an azure like that of the sky, as its alternative name indicates.
On the outside of the fennel-flower are five green, firm pieces joined together at
the bottom but terminating in long points at the top. Each of these pieces is called
a sepal, and the five together form the calyx. Inside are five other pieces, thin,
fine, broad, purplish red in color. Each one bears the name of petal, and collectively
they form the corolla.
</p>
<p>“Most flowers have two envelopes like these, one within the other. The outer one,
or calyx, is nearly always green in color and firm in structure; the inner one, or
corolla, much more delicate in texture, is tinged with those magnificent hues that
please the eye so much in flowers.
</p>
<p>“The sepals of the calyx and the petals of the corolla are sometimes separated from
one another and sometimes joined together. In the fennel-flower the sepals are united
below in a common sheath bristling with coarse hairs; but in their upper part they
are <span class="pageNum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>separated into five narrow and pointed strips. The corolla we find to be composed
of five pieces, five petals distinct from one another. On the contrary, in the blossom
of the campanula the five petals of the corolla are joined at the edges and form a
beautiful blue bell which looks as if made of one piece. The five large teeth that
border the opening of the bell nevertheless show that the corolla is really composed
of five petals, of which these teeth are the termination.
</p>
<div class="figure floatRight p145width"><img src="images/p145.png" alt="Fennel Flower" width="204" height="341"><p class="figureHead">Fennel Flower</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“The calyx and the corolla are the flower’s clothing, a double clothing having both
the substantial material that protects from cold and storm, and the fine fabric that
charms the eye. The calyx, the outer garment, is of simple form, green in color, and
of firm texture suitable for withstanding bad weather. It has to protect the still
unopened flower, to shield it from the sun, from cold and wet. Examine a rose-bud
and note with what delicate precision the five sepals of the calyx are united so as
to cover the rest. Not the slightest drop of water could penetrate the interior, so
carefully are their edges joined together. There are flowers that close their calyx
every evening <span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>and snuggle down inside to keep from getting chilled.
</p>
<p>“The corolla or inner garment unites elegance of form and richness of tint with fineness
of texture. It is the flower’s finery and is what especially captivates our eye, so
that we commonly consider it the most important part of the blossom, whereas it is
really nothing but an ornament.
</p>
<p>“Of the two garments, the calyx is the more necessary. Many flowers have no corolla,
but they always have at least a calyx, which in its simplest form is reduced to a
tiny leaflet shaped like a scale. Flowers with no corolla remain unnoticed, and the
plants that bear them seem to us to have no blossoms. It is a mistake: all trees and
plants bloom, even the oak, willow, poplar, pine, beech, wheat, and multitudes of
others whose blossoming is unheeded by the inattentive eye. Their flowers are extremely
numerous, but as they are very small and have no bright-colored corolla they escape
any but the closest scrutiny.
</p>
<p>“It would be knowing a person very little only to be able to say that he wears such
and such a coat; nor does one know a flower any better when one can merely say that
it is clothed with a calyx and a corolla. What is there under this clothing?
</p>
<p>“Let us examine together a lily, which by its size lends itself readily to study.
It has no calyx,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1705src" href="#xd31e1705">1</a> but <span class="pageNum" id="pb147">[<a href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>it does have a superb corolla formed of six petals gracefully curved inward at the
edges, and whiter than ivory. I take away these six petals. What is left now is the
essential part; that is to say, the thing without which the flower could not perform
its function, could not, in short, bear fruit or seed. Let us carefully consider this
remaining part. You will find it well worth the trouble.
</p>
<p>“First there are six filaments or little white rods, each one surmounted by a tiny
bag full of yellow powder. These six pieces are called stamens. They are found in
all flowers in greater or less number, and in the lily there are six of them. The
little bag that tops the stamen is called an anther. The yellow dust contained in
the anther is called pollen; that is what daubs our nose when we smell the lily too
closely.
</p>
<p>“I take away the six stamens. There remains a central body swollen at the bottom,
narrowed at the top to a long filament, and surmounted by a kind of head wet with
a sticky moisture. In its entirety this central body bears the name of pistil; the
swelling at the bottom is called the ovary, the filament growing out of it is the
style, and the sticky head terminating this filament is known as the stigma.
</p>
<p>“What big names for such little things! you will say. Little, yes; but of unrivaled
importance. These little things, my friends, give us our daily bread; without the
miraculous work of these little things the world would come to an end.
</p>
<p>“With a penknife I cut the ovary in two horizontally. <span class="pageNum" id="pb148">[<a href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>In three compartments grouped in a circle we see some tiny grains arranged so that
each compartment has two rows of them. They are the future seeds of the plant. The
ovary, then, is the part of the plant where the seeds are formed. After a certain
time the flower withers, the petals wilt and fall, the calyx does the same, or sometimes
it remains to play the part of protector a while longer, the dried stamens break off,
and only the ovary remains, growing larger, ripening, and finally becoming the fruit
that contains the seeds.
</p>
<p>“Every sort of fruit—the pear, apple, apricot, peach, walnut, cherry, melon, grape,
almond, chestnut—began by being a little swelling of the pistil; all those excellent
things that the tree and plant give us for food were first ovaries.”
</p>
<p>“Then a big juicy pear began by being the ovary of a pear blossom?” queried Emile.
</p>
<p>“Yes, my friend,” was the reply; “pears, apples, cherries, apricots, even big melons
and enormous pumpkins begin by being the little ovaries of their respective flowers.
I will show you an apricot in its blossom.”
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p148width"><img src="images/p148.png" alt="Apricot Blossom Cut Open" width="149" height="144"><p class="figureHead">Apricot Blossom Cut Open</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Uncle Paul took an apricot blossom, opened it with his penknife, and showed his listeners
what is here reproduced in the picture.
</p>
<p>“In the heart of the flower,” he explained, “you see the pistil surrounded by numerous
stamens. <span class="pageNum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>The head at the top of it is the stigma; the swelling at the bottom is the ovary or
future apricot.”
</p>
<p>“That little green thing,” Emile exclaimed incredulously, “would have turned into
a plump, juicy apricot such as I am so fond of?”
</p>
<p>“Yes,” affirmed his uncle, “that little green thing would have turned into an apricot
such as Emile is so fond of. A similar little green thing would have turned into a
big juicy pear, into a fragrant apple, or into a huge pumpkin, so heavy that it rests
lazily on its stomach. To conclude, I will show you the ovary from which come wheat
and consequently bread.”
</p>
<p>Uncle Paul took a needle; then with the skill and patience necessary for this operation
he isolated one of the numerous flowers that collectively make up the ear of wheat.
The delicate little flower displayed clearly, on the point of the needle, the different
parts composing it.
</p>
<p>“The blessed plant that gives us bread,” continued Uncle Paul, “has very modest flowers.
Two poor scales serve it for calyx and corolla. You can easily recognize three hanging
stamens with their double-sacheted anthers full of pollen. The main body of the flower
is the plump ovary which, when ripe, will be a grain of wheat. It is surmounted by
the stigma, which has the shape of an elegant double plume. Such is the modest little
flower that furnishes us all with the staff of life.”

<p class="first">“In a few days, even in a few hours, a flower withers. Petals, calyx, stamens fade
and die. Only one part survives: the ovary, which is to become fruit. Now, in order
to outlive the rest of the flower and remain on its stem when all else dries up and
falls, the ovary at the moment of blossoming, receives an access of vigor, I might
almost say a new life. The magnificence of the corolla, its sumptuous coloring, its
perfume, all serve to celebrate the solemn moment when this new vitality is awakened
in the ovary. This great act accomplished, the flower has had its day.
</p>
<p>“Well, it is the dust of the stamens, the pollen, that gives this increase of energy
without which the nascent seeds would perish in the ovary, itself withered. It falls
from the stamens on to the stigma, which constantly wears a sticky coating designed
to hold it; and from the stigma it makes its mysterious influence felt in the very
depths of the ovary. Animated then with new life, the nascent seeds develop rapidly,
while the ovary swells so as to give them the nourishment and the space they require.
The final result of this incomprehensible travail <span class="pageNum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span>is the fruit, with its contained seeds all ready to germinate.
</p>
<p>“Let us cite a few of the numerous experiments that prove the absolute indispensability
of pollen.
</p>
<p>“Most flowers have both stamens and pistils; but there are plants that have their
stamens and pistils in separate flowers. Sometimes the flowers with stamens only and
those with pistils only are found on the same plant; sometimes they are found on separate
plants. Plants having flowers with stamens only and flowers with pistils only on the
same stock are called monœcious plants. This expression means ‘living in one house.’
The flowers with stamens and those with pistils do indeed live together in the same
house, since they are found on the same plant. The pumpkin, cucumber, melon, hazel-nut-tree
are monœcious plants.

</p>
<p>“Where flowers with stamens and those with pistils are found on different stocks,
the plants are termed diœcious; that is to say, they are double-house plants. Hemp,
the locust-tree, and the date-tree are diœcious.
</p>
<p>“It is especially in monœcious and diœcious plants <span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span>that the pollen’s indispensability is plainly manifest on account of the natural separation
of the stamens and pistils. Let us take for example the locust, a tree of extreme
southern France, bearing seeds in pods similar to those of the pea, but brown, very
long, and very wide, and containing in addition to the seeds a sugary pulp. Supposing
we took a notion, if the climate permitted, to grow locust seeds in our garden, what
locust tree must we plant? Evidently the one with pistils, because it alone produces
the ovaries that become fruit. But that is not enough. Planted by itself, the locust
tree with pistils will indeed blossom profusely every year, but will never in all
eternity bear any seeds, for its flowers will fall without leaving a single ovary
on the branches. What is wanting? The action of the pollen. Near the locust with pistils
let us plant one with stamens. Now fructification proceeds as we wish. Puffs of wind,
insects that pilfer from one flower and carry to another—these convey the pollen from
the stamens to the stigmas, the torpid ovaries spring to life, and the locust pods
grow and ripen perfectly. With pollen, seeds; without pollen, no seeds.
</p>
<p>“Another example. In spots of fertile land in Northern Africa, spots of land called
oases, the Arabs cultivate numerous date-trees which provide them with dates, their
principal food. Date-trees, too, like the locust, are diœcious. Now, in the country
of the date-tree, a sandy plain parched by the sun, spots of watered and fertile land
are rare and have to be turned to the utmost possible account. <span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span>Accordingly the Arabs plant only date-trees with pistils, the only ones that will
produce dates. But when they are in flower, the Arabs go long distances to fetch bunches
of blossoms with stamens from wild date trees in order to shake the pollen on the
trees they have planted. Without this precaution there is no harvest.
</p>
<p>“But I am coming to an example that will be more familiar to us. The pumpkin is monœcious:
flowers with stamens and flowers with pistils inhabit the same house, the same vine.
Before they are full-blown they can easily be distinguished from each other. The flowers
with pistils have under the corolla a large swelling which is the ovary, the future
pumpkin. The blossoms with stamens have not this swelling. Well, from one pumpkin
vine standing apart in the garden let us cut off all the buds with stamens before
they open, and leave those with pistils. For greater surety we will wrap each one
of these latter in a piece of gauze large enough to let the flower develop without
hindrance. This operation must be carried out before the buds open, in order to make
sure that the stigmas have not already received any pollen. Under these conditions,
not being able to receive the vivifying dust, since the flowers with stamens are cut
off, and since also the gauze wrappings keep out the insects that might bring the
pollen they had pilfered from some neighboring pumpkin vine, the pistillate flowers
will wither after languishing awhile, and their ovaries will dry up without growing
into pumpkins. If, <span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>however, we wish any selected blossoms to fructify in spite of their gauze prison
and the suppression of the staminate blossoms, we take a small camel’s hair brush
and gather a little pollen which we put on the stigma. That is enough, the pumpkin
will come.
</p>
<p>“The absolute necessity of pollen for the formation of fruit explains to us the harmful
effect of violent winds and prolonged rains in blossoming time. Swept away by blasts
of wind, or washed away by rains, or simply spoiled by long-continued moisture, the
dust of the stamens no longer acts on the ovaries, and the flowers fall without fructifying.
This ruin of the harvest from lack of pollen is known as blight.”

<h2 class="main">THE GRAIN OF WHEAT</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Now turn your attention to this picture of an ivy seed cut through lengthwise. Where
is the germ or little plant in its egg? It is that little white thing, rather long
and narrow, embedded in the substance of the seed at one end. A fine line marks the
division of the two cotyledons, which are now pressed close together. Next to them
comes the tigella, or little stalk, ending in the radicle, or rootlet. Notice, my
friends, how small these cotyledons are, how different from the enormous nursing-leaves
of the almond, acorn, broad bean, kidney bean, and pea. These poor little plant-udders
must soon get dried up, and if there were no other resources available at the time
of germination the ivy would speedily starve to death.
</p>
<div class="figure floatRight p155width"><img src="images/p155.png" alt="Longitudinal Section of Ivy Seed" width="59" height="102"><p class="figureHead">Longitudinal Section of Ivy Seed</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“But look: under the skin of the seed we find a goodly store of farinaceous matter,
in which the germ is embedded. Almost the whole of the seed consists of this accumulation
of flour. So here we have the food-supply that will supplement that contained in the
cotyledons, a very insufficient provision in itself. This granary of plenty within
which the germ is lodged, this storehouse of food is called the <span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>perisperm. The almond, acorn, pea, bean, with a host of others, are quite lacking
in anything of the sort, having under the skin only the germ and nothing more, absolutely
nothing. The reason for this difference is plain enough. The almond, bean, pea, acorn,
with their big cotyledons bursting with nutritive matter, do not need a supplementary
ration; the germ will be sufficiently suckled by the udders nature has provided in
the form of these cotyledons. But the ivy, with its poor little cotyledons, calls
for help, and finds it in the farinaceous storehouse of the perisperm.
</p>
<p>“Thus a seed may have a double supply of nourishment to meet the needs of the young
plant: that contained in the cotyledons and that stored up in the perisperm. Cotyledons
are never lacking, but the perisperm is not found in all seeds. There is none in the
almond, acorn, chestnut, apricot, bean, or pea; but to make up for this lack their
cotyledons are of considerable size. On the other hand, buckwheat, chickweed, and
ivy, whose cotyledons are small, are provided with a perisperm. All this may be reduced
to one general rule. Cotyledons and perisperm play similar parts: they both help to
nourish the little plant in its infancy. So, generally speaking, the seed with large
cotyledons has no perisperm, while the seed with small cotyledons has one.

<div class="figure floatRight p157width"><img src="images/p157.png" alt="Longitudinal Section of a Grain of Wheat" width="118" height="204"><p class="figureHead">Longitudinal Section of a Grain of Wheat</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“I have just told you that many plants have only one cotyledon. I will add that this
cotyledon is usually very small. It is especially in these plants that the perisperm
is present. The grain of wheat offers <span class="pageNum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>a notable illustration of this truth. Cut lengthwise and looked at through a magnifying-glass,
this seed would reveal to us what is represented in the picture I now show you. At
the bottom and toward one side is the germ, forming but a very small part of the seed.
At <i>c</i> is the single cotyledon, whence will come the first leaf, the seminal leaf. At <i>e</i> is the gemmule, which will furnish the next leaves. At the opposite end is a short
nipple, the radicle, whence the root will spring. Now compare the tiny cotyledon of
the wheat with the two voluminous ones of the almond. The latter, with their rich
store of nourishment, will easily be able to feed the young plant until it has vigorous
roots; but the cotyledon of the wheat, so poor and slender—can it nourish the young
plant? Certainly not. Then the wheat germ must without fail have a storehouse of provisions.
This storehouse is the perisperm (<i>pr</i>), a farinaceous mass constituting nearly the whole of the seed. This same perisperm,
the first food of the wheat’s first shoot, is also the chief food of man; it is what,
under the millstone, becomes flour, of which bread is made. But how can the farinaceous
substance of the perisperm nourish the plant? A very simple experiment will show us.
Put some wheat in a saucer and keep it slightly moist. In a short time the seed will
germinate. As soon as the young sprouts show their green points <span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span>take one of the grains: you will find it softened all through. You can crush it between
your fingers and squeeze out a white fluid, very sweet to the taste and much resembling
some sort of milk. What has taken place ought not to be beyond your power to surmise
from the account I gave you of the wonderful change starch may undergo. The perisperm
of the wheat-grain consists chiefly of starch. During germination this accumulation
of starch is converted into a sugary substance, into glucose in fact. Thence comes
the sort of plant-milk with which the seed is now swollen. The germ is immersed in
this sweet liquid; it imbibes it, soaks it up almost as a fine sponge would; and with
the matter thus absorbed it augments its own substance, which lengthens into root,
stem, and leaves. With what furnishes us bread the grain of wheat suckles the starting
wheat-stalk.”

<h2 class="main">CULTIVATED PLANTS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Three modes of plant-propagation are in use among horticulturists, namely: layering,
slipping, and grafting. To get an adequate notion of the great usefulness of these
operations let us dwell for a moment on the origin of our cultivated plants.
</p>
<p>“You perhaps imagine that from the beginning of time, in view of our need of food,
the pear-tree was eager to bear large fruit, plump and juicy; that the potato, just
to accommodate us, stuffed its big tubers with farinaceous matter; that the cabbage,
in its desire to gratify us, conceived the idea of gathering those beautiful white
leaves into a compact head. You imagine that wheat, pumpkins, carrots, grapes, beets,
and no one knows what besides, possessed with a great interest in man, have always
worked for him of their own accord. You think that our grapes of to-day are like those
from which Noah extracted the juice that made him drunk; that wheat, ever since it
appeared on the earth, has never failed to yield its annual harvest of grain; that
the beet and the pumpkin had at the beginning of the world the plumpness that makes
them prized by us now. You imagine, in short, that our food-plants came to us originally
just as we have them now. Undeceive yourselves: <span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>the wild plant is usually of very little nutritive value to man. His is still the
task of so cultivating it as to derive advantage from its natural aptitudes by improving
them.
</p>
<p>“In its native country, on the mountains of Chile and Peru, the potato in its wild
state is a poor diminutive tuber about as large as a hazel-nut. Man takes the worthless
wild stock into his garden, plants it in rich soil, tends it, waters it; and behold,
from year to year the potato thrives more and more, gaining in size and in nutritive
properties, and finally becoming a farinaceous tuber as large as your two fists.
</p>
<p>“On the sea-coasts, exposed to all the winds that blow, there grows a wild cabbage
with a tall stalk and a few green leaves of bitter taste and rank odor. But beneath
its rude exterior it may perhaps hide invaluable aptitudes. Apparently this suspicion
occurred to him who first, so long ago that the record of it is lost, took the sea-coast
cabbage under cultivation. The suspicion was well-founded. The wild cabbage has been
improved by man’s incessant care: its stalk has become firmer and its leaves have
multiplied, whitened, acquired tenderness, and massed themselves in a compact head,
so that we have the crisp and succulent cabbage of to-day as the admirable result
of this notable metamorphosis. There on the sea-coast rock was the first beginning
of the excellent plant; here in our gardens is its present attainment. But what about
its intermediate forms which, through the centuries, marked the gradual <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>development of the species to its present high state of perfection? Each of these
forms was a step forward, and each had to be preserved, kept from degenerating, and
made the subject of still further improvement. Who could tell the story of all the
labor and pains it has taken to produce the cabbage-head as we now have it?
</p>
<p>“And the wild pear-tree—are you acquainted with it? It is a frightful bramble-bush,
all bristling with sharp thorns; and the pears themselves—a most repellent fruit,
sure to choke you and set your teeth on edge—are very small, sour, hard, and full
of grit that reminds one of gravel-stones. Surely he must have had an extraordinary
inspiration who first pinned his faith on this crabbed specimen of underbrush and
foresaw in the remote future the butter-pear on which we regale ourselves to-day.
</p>
<p>“In the same way, by the painstaking culture of the primitive vine, whose grapes were
no larger than our elderberries, man has, in the sweat of his brow, developed the
luscious fruit of the modern vineyard. From some poor species of grass now forgotten
he has also produced the wheat that to-day supplies us with bread. A few wretched
herbs and shrubs, far from promising in appearance, he has cultivated and improved
until they became the vegetables and fruit trees so prized by us at present. This
old earth of ours, in order to make us work and thus <span class="corr" id="xd31e1818" title="Source: fulfil">fulfill</span> the law of our existence, has behaved to us like a harsh stepmother. To the birds
of the air she gives food in abundance, but to us she offers of her own free <span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>will nothing but wild blackberries and sour sloes. But let us not complain, for the
stern struggle with necessity is precisely what constitutes our grandeur.
</p>
<p>“It is for us, by our intelligence and labor, to work our way out of the difficulty;
upon us it is enjoined to put into practice the noble creed, God helps those who help
themselves.
</p>
<p>“Thus from the earliest times it has been man’s study to select from the countless
forms of vegetation at his disposal those that best lend themselves to improvement.
The greater number of species have remained useless to us, but others, predestined
no doubt, and created especially with a view to man’s needs, have responded to our
efforts and acquired through cultivation qualities of prime importance, since our
sustenance depends on them. Nevertheless the improvement attained is not so radical
that we can count on its permanence if our vigilance relaxes. The plant always tends
to revert to its primitive state. For example, let the gardener leave the headed cabbage
to itself without fertilizing, watering, or cultivating it; let him leave the seeds
to germinate by chance wherever the wind blows them, and the cabbage will quickly
part with its compact head of white leaves and resume the loose green leaves of its
wild ancestors. In like manner the vine, set free from man’s constant attention, will
degenerate into the little-esteemed wild species that haunts our hedge-rows and yields
a scant harvest that will not, all together, be worth a single bunch of cultivated
grapes. The pear-tree, if neglected, will again <span class="pageNum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>be found on the outskirts of our woods, once more bristling with long sharp thorns
and bearing under-sized and extremely unpalatable fruit. Under like conditions the
plum-tree and the cherry-tree will bear nothing but stones covered with a sour skin.
In short, all the riches of our orchards will in similar circumstances undergo such
deterioration as to be worthless to us.
</p>
<p>“This reversion to the wild state occurs even under cultivation and in spite of efforts
to prevent it when seed is used for propagating the plant. Suppose the seeds from
an excellent pear are put into the ground. Well, the trees that spring from those
seeds will bear for the most part only mediocre or poor, even very poor, pears. Another
planting is made with the pits of the second generation, and the result shows still
further decline. Thus if the experiment is continued with seeds taken each time from
the immediately preceding generation, the fruit, becoming smaller and smaller, bitterer
and harder, will at last return to the sorry wild pear of the thicket.
</p>
<p>“One more example. What flower equals the rose in nobleness of carriage, in perfume
and brilliant coloring? Suppose we plant the seeds of this superb flower; its descendants
will turn out to be miserable bushes, nothing but wild roses like those of our hedges.
But we need not be surprised at this. The noble plant had the wild rose for ancestor,
and in trying to propagate it by its seed we have simply caused it to resume its native
characteristics.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb164">[<a href="#pb164">164</a>]</span></p>
<p>“With some plants, let us note in conclusion, the improvement attained by cultivation
is more stable and persists even when the seed is used for purposes of propagation;
but this persistence is only on the express condition that our vigilance shall not
relax. All plants, if left to themselves and propagated by seed, revert to the primitive
state after a certain number of generations in which the characteristics imposed by
human skill and care gradually disappear.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb165">[<a href="#pb165">165</a>]</span></p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<h2 class="main">DIFFERENT WAYS OF PROPAGATING</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Since our fruit-trees and ornamental plants, if propagated by seed, revert sooner
or later to the wild type, how can they be propagated without risk of degeneration?
This must be done by means of the buds instead of the seeds. Buds or branches of a
plant or tree must be transplanted from one stock to another; this is called grafting;
or they may be planted directly in the soil by processes known as layering and slipping.
These are invaluable methods, since they enable us to stabilize in the plant the improvements
attained after long years of labor, and thus to profit by these improvements, which
we owe to our predecessors, instead of beginning all over again a course of training
that would demand far more than a single life-time.
</p>
<p>“Layering, slipping, and grafting insure the faithful reproduction of all the qualities
of the parent stock. As are the fruit, flowers, foliage of this parent stock which
has furnished the buds or slips for transplanting, so will be the fruit, flowers,
foliage of the resulting plant or tree. Nothing will be added to the qualities we
wish to perpetuate, but on the other hand nothing will be subtracted. To the double
flowers of the original from which came the <span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>layer, the slip, or the graft, will correspond the double flowers of the plant developing
from this layer, slip, or graft: the same shade of coloring will be reproduced, and
the fruit will have the same size, savor, and sweetness. The slightest peculiarity
which, for unknown reasons, appears in a plant grown from the seed, and which sometimes
is found only on a single branch, as the indented outline of the leaves or the variegation
of the blossoms, is reproduced with minute accuracy if the graft, slip, or layer is
taken from the branch having this modification. By this means horticulture is daily
enriching itself with double flowers or a new shade, or with fruit remarkable for
its size, its early or late ripening, its juicy flesh, its more pronounced aroma.
Without the help of graft and slip these fortunate accidents, occurring but once and
no one knows how, would lead to no further profit after the death of the plant thus
favored by chance; and horticulture would find itself compelled to repeat over and
over again its attempts to bring about improvements which, almost as soon as effected,
would invariably be lost for want of means to fix them and render them permanent.
</p>
<p>“If history had preserved the record, what long and painful efforts to develop our
various cultivated plants from worthless seedlings should we not read there! Just
think of what a happy inspiration it must have taken to select exactly the kind of
vegetable or other plant susceptible of improvement, what patient experimental attempts
to subject it to <span class="pageNum" id="pb167">[<a href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>cultivation, what wearisome labor to improve its quality from one year to another,
what care to prevent its degenerating and to hand it down to posterity in perfect
condition. Think of all this and you will see how the smallest fruit, the smallest
vegetable, represents more than the toil of him who has raised it in his garden. It
represents, perhaps, the accumulated effort of a hundred generations, an effort indispensable
if we are to have a succulent pot-herb as the descendant of a worthless weed. We live
on the fruit and vegetables created by our predecessors; we live on the labor, strength,
ideas of the past. May the future in its turn live on our strength both of arm and
thought! So shall we worthily fulfill our mission.
</p>
<p>“It was not chance that gave man the idea of layering, slipping, and grafting, but
rather the thoughtful observation of nature’s methods all about him. He who was first,
for example, to note how the strawberry grows and multiplies, received the first lesson
in layering. Let us in our turn examine this curious process.
</p>
<div class="figure p168width"><img src="images/p168.png" alt="Strawberry Runner" width="416" height="185"><p class="figureHead">Strawberry Runner</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“From the parent stock of the strawberry vine a number of runners start out, long,
slender, and creeping on the ground. These runners are also known as stolons or creeping
suckers. After reaching a certain distance they expand at the end into a little tuft
which takes root in the ground and is soon self-supporting. The new tuft of the strawberry
vine, as soon as strong enough, in its turn sends out long runners which follow the
example of the first <span class="pageNum" id="pb168">[<a href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>ones; that is to say, they creep along the ground, end each in a rosette of leaves,
and take root. The picture shows us a first tuft, more vigorous than the others. From
the axil of one of its leaves starts a runner whose terminal bud has developed into
a small plant already provided with roots of some vigor. A second runner sprung from
this plant bears a third rosette whose leaves are beginning to unfold. After sending
out an indefinite number of similar runners the mother plant finds herself surrounded
with young suckers, established here and there, as many as the season and the nature
of the soil permit. At first these suckers are attached to the mother plant by the
runners, and sap flows from the old plant to the young ones; but sooner or later there
is a severance of ties, the runners dry up and are henceforward useless, and each
offshoot, properly rooted, becomes a separate strawberry vine. Here we find, without
any of man’s ingenuity or skill, all the details of layering; and it was undoubtedly
the natural process that suggested the artificial <span class="pageNum" id="pb169">[<a href="#pb169">169</a>]</span>method. A long branch bends down to the ground, takes root there, and then becomes
detached from the parent stock by the death or destruction of the connecting part.
The horticulturist lays a long shoot in the ground, waits until it sends down adventitious
roots, and finally severs the connection with his pruning-shears. That is layering.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span></p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<h2 class="main">LAYERING</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Some plants, and among them the pink, send out from the base of the mother stalk
straight, pliant shoots which can be used for obtaining so many new plants. These
shoots are bedded by being bent elbow-wise and having the angle stuck into the ground
and fastened there with a crotch; then the end is raised upright and held so by means
of a stake. Sooner or later the buried elbow sends down adventitious roots, but until
then nourishment is drawn from the parent stock. When the buried parts have sent down
enough roots, the connections are cut between the old plant and the new ones, and
each of these latter, set out by itself, is thenceforth a distinct plant. This operation
is called layering, and the several shoots used in obtaining new plants are called
layers.
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p170width"><img src="images/p170.png" alt="Layering" width="110" height="93"><p class="figureHead">Layering</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“Let us now put into practice the method we have just been studying in theory. In
a vineyard, we will suppose, a number of the vines have died from some cause or other,
and it is necessary to replace them. Layering offers us the readiest means and will
occasion least delay to the harvest. Near the place occupied by the dead vine we select
a stock provided <span class="pageNum" id="pb171">[<a href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>with a vigorous shoot of sufficient length and conveniently situated. Then we dig
down where the old vine stands and pull up all of the lifeless stalk as well as the
roots, since these are seats of decay that might infect the whole neighborhood. Finally,
in the soil thus stirred we dig a ditch two or three decimeters deep, and in this
we lay the shoot we have selected, taking care in bending it down not to break or
splinter it. The part thus put into the ground is then covered with a tolerably thick
layer of earth, and on this, to complete the filling of the ditch, is thrown a basketful
of manure. The tip of the shoot is raised upright, tied to a stake, and trimmed in
such a manner as to retain only two eyes or buds above ground. As to the eyes on the
part extending from the mother stem to the point where the shoot plunges into the
ground, they are nipped off because they would needlessly appropriate a part of the
sap. This operation is called vine-layering, and the shoot bent down and placed in
the ground we speak of as a vine-layer. The best time for this work is the beginning
of winter, because the long rest enjoyed by the shoot in the ground throughout the
season when vegetation slumbers disposes it to sprout with more vigor upon the renewal
of sap-circulation in the spring.
</p>
<p>“Let us now watch the behavior of the partly buried vine-shoot. If it had remained
all in the open air, it would have borne fruit; it would have had its three or four
bunches of grapes. Why should it not do so under the conditions imposed by the vine-dresser,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>conditions that have altered nothing in its relations to the mother stem? It still
remains in uninterrupted communication with the vine that sustains it; it receives
its share of ascending sap drawn from the soil by the roots of this vine; the buds
remaining to it will develop leaves which, with the help of sunlight, will convert
this crude sap into elaborated sap; in short, it lacks nothing to enable it to function
almost as it would have done had it not been partly buried. And in fact the vine-layer
does bear that same year; if well cared for, it bears several bunches of grapes. So
the proverb says: The vine-layer pays its owner from the very first year. Meanwhile,
acted on by the coolness and moisture of the soil and the stimulus of fertilization,
it puts forth adventitious roots where it has been placed underground, and these roots
grow in number and vigor until the time comes when they suffice to nourish the young
vine without the help of the mother stem. It is in the third year that the rooting
is far enough advanced for the young offshoot’s independent existence. Weaning is
then undertaken, and the nursling is deprived of its nurse; that is to say, a stroke
of the pruning-knife close to the ground and on the side toward the parent stock separates
the latter from the vine-layer, which becomes henceforth self-supporting.
</p>
<p>“With its long shoots so near the ground the vine offers every convenience for carrying
out the operation just described; but as a general rule shrubs and trees are far less
favorably situated: their branches <span class="pageNum" id="pb173">[<a href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>are not long enough or flexible enough or (a prime essential) near enough to the ground
to be bent down and laid in the trench dug for receiving the layer. How is this difficulty
to be overcome? The way is very simple. We have already observed the effect of cutting
back; we know that a stem cut back, that is to say cut off close to the ground, develops
around the border of its wound numerous adventitious buds which grow into so many
shoots. They are precisely the sort of shoots we need, long, flexible, and starting
from the level of the ground. Each of them, if treated as a layer, partly buried in
a trench where it is fixed with a crotch, and held, above ground, in a vertical position
by means of a prop, takes root sooner or later according to its species, and can then
be transferred as an independent plant to any desired spot. Such is the simple method
known both as layering and as arching, because it is essentially the same as ordinary
layering and at the same time necessitates the bending of the young shoot so as to
describe an arch.
</p>
<p>“The following method dispenses with this bending, which is impracticable when the
wood is too brittle. In the spring the stalk or trunk that is to furnish the layers
is cut back. All around this cross-section young shoots soon make their appearance,
after which it is only necessary to wait until they are long enough but have not yet
lost their tenderness, a state most conducive to the growth of adventitious buds;
then the parent trunk is earthed up, or in other words light soil is heaped all about
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb174">[<a href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>stump so as to cover the lower part of each shoot. The earth is piled up in the shape
of a truncated cone with a cup-shaped hollow at the top to receive water from time
to time and thus maintain the necessary degree of moisture and coolness. Kept damp
and cool in this manner, the young shoots will before long send down adventitious
roots, and the following year there will be a cluster of rooted plants that can easily
be detached with a knife. That is what is called layering by earthing up or by sprouting.
</p>
<p>“If it is found undesirable to cut back the parent stem in order to obtain shoots
for layering, and if at the same time the shoot that we wish to root is too high to
be bent down and inserted in the ground, the following expedient may be employed.
A flower-pot broken in two lengthwise or a leaden cornucopia is hung on the tree,
and the branch to be rooted is placed lengthwise in the pot or cornucopia. The pot
is then filled with mold or moss kept damp by frequent watering, and the result, sooner
or later, is the growth of adventitious roots. When these are suitably developed,
gradual weaning is next in order; that is to say, underneath the pot a slight cut
is made, and this is deepened day by day. The end here in view is to accustom the
layer little by little to do without the mother stem and support itself. At last the
separation is complete. This gradual weaning is no less advantageous when the layers
are placed in the ground: it assures the success of the operation.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb175">[<a href="#pb175">175</a>]</span></p>
<p>“If the wood is tender, adventitious roots spring without difficulty from the interred
part, and the methods already described suffice for the success of the layering; but
woods of dense structure are more or less obstinate about taking root, and might remain
in the ground indefinitely without yielding. In such cases our art must intervene,
based on the plant’s manner of living. Let us recall the effect of a band drawn tightly
about a stalk or trunk. Above this line of strangulation the descending sap accumulates
more and more, since it can no longer continue on its course between the wood and
the bark, this latter being compressed by the ligature. It accumulates and produces
a ring-shaped swelling where the plant tries to discharge on the outside the superabundance
of matter arrested in its passage. Let this protuberance be heaped about with fresh
earth, and adventitious roots will speedily be developed to allow the sap to continue
its descent. A tiny streamlet, running free, follows its channel without effort and
without any undermining of obstacles. But if we obstruct its passage the accumulating
body of water will gain power to open new vents for itself through the dam. Sap does
likewise. Circulating freely in its natural channel, it is not diverted from its course
by any allurements on its way; and unless the conditions present in wood and bark
favor the growth of new roots, no sap will be expended for this purpose. But if its
usual passage is barred, the sap devotes its energies to the formation of adventitious
roots in order that <span class="pageNum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>it may, through them, resume its interrupted course. A like result follows if a ring
of bark is removed from the buried part of the branch or shoot that we wish to take
root. The arrested sap produces a ring-shaped swelling on the upper edge of the wound,
and from this swelling spring roots.
</p>
<p>“Now let us apply these theoretical principles. If the wood is compact and for that
reason rebels against the laws of simple layering, we will take a piece of wire and
strangle (that is the word) the branch we are operating upon; that is to say, we will
bind it tight, but without breaking the bark. The compression should be made just
below a bud or eye, and about midway of the part that is to be underground. This process
is called layering by strangulation.
</p>
<p>“Or again, still midway of the part to be bedded in the earth, and immediately under
a bud, we cut the bark all around the branch without injuring the wood; a second incision
is made a centimeter and a half lower down; then tearing off the strip of bark between
the two circumcisions, we remove it all in one piece. This method is known as annular
incision from the ring of bark thus taken away.
</p>
<p>“Or as a third expedient, still midway of the part to be bedded in the trench, we
make with a sharp instrument an oblique incision from below upward, cutting into the
wood as far as the marrow. In this way we are enabled to raise a tongue comprising
half the thickness of the shoot, and this tongue is held in its lifted position by
a small pebble inserted in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb177">[<a href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>slit. This is what we call a Y-shaped incision, because the raised tongue forms with
the rest of the stem an opening like that between the two branches of the letter Y.
Through the half that remains intact communication with the mother stem is maintained
and the needed share of crude sap is received, while from the cut and upraised half
adventitious roots are put forth because the course of the descending sap is arrested
there.
</p>
<p>“In order to bring into contact with the damp soil a greater extent of wounded fiber
fit for putting forth adventitious roots, it is customary to split the upraised tongue
in two and keep the two parts gaping by interposing a small pebble. This method of
double incision is used for trees that offer the greatest resistance to successful
layering.
</p>
<p>“To sum up, all these methods and others derived from them have for their object the
fostering of adventitious roots by arresting the course of the descending sap at a
certain point beneath the soil.”

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<h2 class="main">SLIPPING</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Propagation by means of a slip or scion cut from the parent tree and so placed that
it will develop adventitious roots we may for convenience speak of as slipping. The
cut end of the slip is set in the ground in some cool, moist, shady spot where evaporation
is slow and the temperature mild. For delicate slips the shelter of a bell-glass is
often necessary in order to insure the requisite moisture in the atmosphere and thus
prevent the slip from drying up before it has sent down roots to make good its losses.
For greater surety, if the slip has many leaves, most of the lower ones are removed
in order to reduce the evaporating surface as much as possible without compromising
the plant’s vitality, which resides especially in the upper part. But in many cases
these precautions are needless; thus, to propagate the grape-vine, willow, and poplar,
it suffices merely to thrust the detached scion into the ground.
</p>
<p>“Trees whose wood is soft and well filled with sap are the ones best fitted for slipping;
to this class belongs the willow, with its notably tender fiber. On the other hand,
wood that is dense and hard gives us sure warning that this mode of propagation will
<span class="pageNum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>be found very difficult or even impossible. Thus it would invariably fail with the
oak, the olive, the box-tree, and a great many more hard-wood trees. Furthermore,
slipping offers far less certainty of success than layering, since the layer remains
in communication with the parent stock and is thus supplied with nourishment until
it has acquired roots of its own, whereas the slip, all such communication being abruptly
cut off, is obliged from the outset to rely on its own resources and pass without
help through the difficult period of rootlessness. Among fruit-bearers there are scarcely
any except the grape-vine, the currant-bush, the quince-tree, and a few varieties
of plum and apple trees, that lend themselves to this method of propagation. Among
the larger trees the willow and the poplar take root with no difficulty whatever when
started from the slip. Finally, a great many ornamental species, herbaceous plants
or bushes like the rose, jasmine, and honeysuckle, multiply easily by this method,
the usual one adopted with them by the flower-gardener.
</p>
<p>“Let us go back now to the very simplest case, the one calling for the fewest precautions.
A damp piece of ground on the water’s edge is to be planted with poplars or willows.
Toward the end of winter the forester in charge cuts a sufficient number of vigorous
young branches as large around as a stout cane or even a man’s fist, or perhaps larger,
and from one to four meters long. He removes all the lower twigs, clips the intermediate
ones to half their length, and leaves the upper ones intact if the tree <span class="pageNum" id="pb180">[<a href="#pb180">180</a>]</span>is to be pyramid-shaped; otherwise he gives the top a truncate form. Finally the lower
end is cut to a point with the hatchet, to make it easier to thrust into the ground.
Now the slip is ready for planting, and all that is necessary is to push it well down
into the earth by its pointed end and leave it to itself. Without any further attention,
if the ground is sufficiently damp, adventitious roots will start, and each of the
stakes thus rudely hacked will become a poplar or a willow.
</p>
<p>“But other forms of vegetation are far from manifesting this facility in rooting which
makes possible the growth of a tree from a stake driven into the ground, it may be
with the blow of a club; therefore delicate precautions are necessary for success
if these obdurate subjects are to be propagated by slips. Let us take the grape-vine
as an example. Its slips for planting are shoots of the same year’s growth. These
are tied in a bundle and their cut ends placed in water to soak for a week or more.
Why this long immersion of the part that later is to be planted in the ground? Because
the outside bark is dry and tough, difficult for tender roots to pierce, especially
if the soil is dry. Accordingly the bark is softened by soaking for some time in water;
and also, when the slips are taken out of the water, they are lightly scraped where
they are to be in the earth, but left untouched where they are to be in the air. In
this way the outer layer of bark is removed after being softened in water, and there
is so much the less resistance offered to the growing roots; <span class="pageNum" id="pb181">[<a href="#pb181">181</a>]</span>but the inner layers, where the vine’s vital activities go on, are scrupulously spared.
The slight wounds inflicted by this scraping, let it be further noted, favor the starting
of roots by arresting the sap. After being prepared in this manner the slips are set
out. In soil that has been well worked so that the young roots may push downward without
hindrance, vertical holes are made with a long iron or wooden dibble, and in each
of these holes a slip is inserted to the depth of about half a meter. Fine earth is
then sifted into the hole and well rammed down to insure perfect contact with the
slip, and the operation is finished.
</p>
<p>“Just as the process of layering is facilitated by the formation of a ring-shaped
swelling where the descending sap is arrested in its course either by a ligature or
by the removal of a ring of bark, so the same artifice can be advantageously employed
in propagating by means of slips. Around the shoot selected as slip for the next year’s
planting an iron wire is tightly bound; or, instead of this, a ring of bark is cut
away. By autumn a swelling will have formed all about the stem, whereupon the shoot
is detached and placed in the ground for the winter in order that the swelling may
become a little further enlarged and somewhat softened. In the spring the shoot is
taken up again, trimmed so that it shall have only four or five buds left, and planted
like an ordinary slip. From the ring-shaped swelling caused by the accumulation of
sap roots will start.
</p>
<p>“All the advantages offered by the ring-shaped <span class="pageNum" id="pb182">[<a href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>swelling may be secured with no expenditure of ingenuity on our part. Take hold of
a small branch and pull it down so as to split it off from the main stem. Thus torn
away it will bring with it a sort of spur or splinter from the trunk directly under
the severed branch. This spur, trimmed with a knife to give it a less ragged outline,
will render the same service as the ring-shaped swelling: the descending sap will
be stopped in its course at this point, will accumulate, and will foster the growth
of adventitious roots.
</p>
<p>“Instead of breaking off the branch by tearing it away at its base, one can, with
a stroke of the pruning-knife above this base and another below it, cut the older
limb bearing this branch so that the latter carries with it a piece of the former.
With this piece as a sort of natural bourrelet or swelling, success is rendered more
assured than in any other way.
</p>
<p>“To conclude, let us say a few words about slipping by means of buds, a kind of planting
that uses buds instead of seeds. This method, which requires the nicest care of any,
is adopted only in exceptional cases. Let us suppose we have a very few shoots, or
only one, from some extremely rare variety of grape-vine, and we wish to obtain from
this single shoot the greatest possible number of slips. To this end the shoot is
cut into small pieces about five centimeters long, each bearing a bud midway of its
length. These pieces are then each split in two lengthwise, and the part with the
bud is retained, the other thrown away. Thus prepared, the pieces <span class="pageNum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>are planted in fertile soil with the split surface underneath and the bud just peeping
out of the earth. But to insure any likelihood of success with this method, certain
special conditions not called for in ordinary planting must be observed, as will be
readily understood. The delicate slips are arranged with care in an earthen pan or
pot, and covered with a bell-glass to assure them a moist and warm atmosphere. After
roots have started the slips are transplanted, each being placed in a separate pot
where it gains strength and awaits the proper time for planting in the ground.”

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<h2 class="main">GRAFTING</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Grafting is the process by which a twig or a bud<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1939src" href="#xd31e1939">1</a> is transplanted from one branch to another, or from one tree to another. That which
is to serve as support and sustenance to the transferred part is known as the stock,
while the twig or bud received by it is called the graft.
</p>
<p>“One absolutely necessary condition must be fulfilled if this operation is to be successful:
the transferred part must find on its new nursing-branch nutriment to its taste, that
is to say, a sap like its own. This requires that the two plants, the stock and the
one that furnishes the graft, should be of the same species or at least belong to
closely related species, since likeness of sap and its products can result only from
likeness of organization. It would be a mere waste of time to try to engraft the lilac
upon the rose, or the rose upon the willow, for there is nothing in common between
these three species either in leaves, flowers, or fruit. This difference in structure
is invariably accompanied by a marked difference in respect to nutrition. Hence the
rose-bud would starve to death on a lilac-branch, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb185">[<a href="#pb185">185</a>]</span>the lilac-bud would meet with the same sad fate on a rose-bush. But lilac can very
well be grafted on lilac, rose-bush on rose-bush, vine on vine. And one can even go
further than this: a peach-bud will flourish on an apricot-tree, a cherry-bud on a
plum-tree, and <i>vice versa</i>; for between the members of each of these pairs there is a close and easily discernible
analogy. In short, there must be the closest possible resemblance between the two
plants if grafting is to succeed.
</p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>“The ancients were far from having any clear idea on this absolute need of likeness
in organization. They tell us of grafting the holly with the rose to obtain green
roses, the walnut tree with the grape to produce enormous grapes as large as walnuts.
In our own time has not the project been seriously considered of grafting a vine shoot
on to a mulberry tree in order to restore vigor to the grape whose roots an underground
grub has attacked? Such graftings and others between plants completely unlike have
never been successfully undertaken except in the imagination of those who dreamt them.
</p>
<p>“We have already seen that, grown from seed, our various fruit trees do not, as a
rule, reproduce the quality of fruit of the parent stock; an invincible <span class="pageNum" id="pb186">[<a href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>tendency to revert to the wild state causes the fruit to lose, little by little, from
one generation to another, the improvement it had acquired through cultivation. Thus
the pear, through repeated plantings of the seed, would become increasingly sour,
small, and hard, until it had at last returned to the sorry state of the wild pear
growing on the edge of the woods. But this defect attending growth from the seed is
redeemed by one very desirable quality: the tree thus grown regains more or less the
robustness of its wild type; it is incomparably more vigorous, healthier, longer-lived,
than the artificially perfected tree whose strength is compromised by the very excess
of its fructification. One has vigor, the other fine fruit. The two attributes cannot
go together; if one increases, the other decreases. Well then, these robust specimens
reared from the seed are just what we require for grafting. Used as stocks, they supply
the quality inherent in them, namely, vigor; and the cutting engrafted upon them furnishes
the other quality, excellence of fruit.
</p>
<p>“Accordingly it is the practice to plant the pips of pears and apples, and the stones
of apricots and peaches; and on the trees thus obtained to graft cuttings from pear,
apple, apricot, and peach trees that bear fruit of recognized superiority. In this
way there are united in the same tree the root and trunk of the robust and almost
wild kind with the leaves and blossoms of the weak but artificially improved kind.
Every variety of pear tree is by nature fitted to receive a pear graft, every variety
of peach tree <span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>to receive a peach graft, and so on with all fruit-trees. There is no objection to
selecting as stock any wild pear, cherry, or plum tree that may have sprung up of
itself in hedge or thicket. It is thus for example that the cherry is grafted on two
others of like sort, the wild cherry and the cherry of Saint Lucia, both frequenters
of uncultivated hillsides. The first bears fruit hardly as large as a pea, black,
round, and full of a very dark and rather bitter juice; the second has still smaller
fruit with scarcely any pulp and uneatable. No matter: with grafts from a suitably
chosen source they will cover themselves with the finest cherries. In like manner
our superb garden roses can be grown on the wild rose stock, the common dog rose of
the hedges, whose modest blossoms have only five petals of a pale carnation color
and are well-nigh odorless. Sometimes, again, two species of similar characteristics
are chosen for grafting purposes. Thus the pear grafts well on the quince-tree, the
fruit of the latter being, after all, a sort of big pear; the apricot can be grafted
on the plum; the peach on the plum and, still better, on the almond, so like the peach
in its foliage, its early blossoming, and the structure of its fruit.
</p>
<p>“As a curiosity let us mention the mixing of several kinds of fruit on the same stock.
By means of grafting the same tree can bear, all at one time, almonds, apricots, peaches,
plums, and cherries, because these five kinds admit of reciprocal grafting; another
tree may be covered simultaneously with <span class="pageNum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>pears, quinces, berries of the mountain ash, medlars, and service-berries. These are
very odd instances, certainly, but of no practical interest. It would be a waste of
time to dwell longer on them did they not teach a useful lesson. They demonstrate
that however many fresh grafts are added to a tree, the new-comers exert no influence
outside their own sphere. Whether offshoots of the tree itself or aliens, the grafts
develop, blossom, and fructify, each after its own kind, without contracting any of
its neighbor’s habits. Among the curious phenomena observed in this artificial juxtaposition
of mutually independent grafts, we will mention a pear-tree on which were represented,
by means of grafting, all the different varieties of cultivated pears. Sour or sweet,
dry or juicy, large or small, green or bright-colored, round or long, hard or mellow,
each and all ripened on the same tree and grew again year after year without change,
faithful to the specific character, not of the supporting tree, but of the various
grafts planted on this common stock.
</p>
<p>“The mere bringing together of <span class="corr" id="xd31e1971" title="Source: analagous">analogous</span> plants does not suffice for the success of the operation of grafting; there must
be a considerable extent of contact between those parts of the graft and the stock
that have the most vitality and are consequently best fitted to coalesce. This contact
should be in the inner layers of the bark and in the seat of plant-growth situated
between the wood and the bark. The vital activity of the plant, in fact, resides especially
in this region. It is between the wood <span class="pageNum" id="pb189">[<a href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>and the bark that the elaborated sap descends; there is where new cells and new fibers
are organized, to form on one side a sheet of bark and on the other a layer of wood.
Hence it is there and only there that coalescence is possible between the graft and
the stock.”

<h2 class="main">GRAFTING</h2>
<h2 class="sub">(<i>Continued</i>)</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“There are three principal kinds of grafting, namely: grafting by approach (also called
simply ‘approaching’ or ‘inarching’), grafting by shoots or scions, and grafting by
buds (commonly known as ‘budding’). The form given to the two cut ends that are brought
together and the disposition of the parts thus placed in contact give rise, in practice,
to numerous subdivisions that need not be mentioned here. We will confine ourselves
to the essentials.
</p>
<p>“Grafting by approach is <span class="corr" id="xd31e1988" title="Source: analagous">analogous</span> to layering, with this difference, that the tree to be grafted takes the place of
the soil that receives the layer. In layering we induce the growth of adventitious
roots by partly burying in the ground a branch or shoot still adhering to the stock
that nourishes it. When, acted upon by the soil, roots have started in sufficient
number, the shoot is gradually cut loose until at last it is quite severed from the
parent stock. In grafting by approach it is also proposed to make a branch, a shoot,
a tree-top, while still united to its own stem or stock, take root, so to speak, not
in the ground, but in the substance of a neighboring tree.
</p>
<p>“Let us suppose that two shrubs are growing <span class="pageNum" id="pb191">[<a href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>close together and that we wish to engraft on one of them a twig or shoot of the other.
The parts to be placed in contact receive each a longitudinal gash that penetrates
to the marrow, or even deeper, and the two gashes are made of equal length. These
parts are then brought together, care being taken to make the young and growing portions
in the one exactly meet those in the other; that is to say, the inner layer of bark
in each, with the channel traversed by the elaborated sap, is carefully fitted to
the corresponding part in its neighbor. The whole is thereupon made fast with a ligature,
and the two wounds are left to the slow operation of vital forces. Fed by its own
stem or trunk, from which it is not yet separated, the shoot to be transplanted mingles
its sap with the sap of its neighbor; on both sides there are new growths to cicatrize
the wounds, while the two parts gradually coalesce until, sooner or later, the graft
becomes incorporated with its future support. And now the graft must be weaned; that
is, it must, little by little, be deprived of the sustenance furnished by its own
stock. This is accomplished as in simple layering, by gradually cutting through the
shoot below the point of union. As soon as the graft is thought to be getting all
its nourishment from the new stem, it is completely severed from the mother tree.
This mode of grafting, the most elementary of all, sometimes takes place accidentally
and unassisted. In a hedge or any dense growth of bushes, if two branches chance to
come into close and prolonged contact, there will be at <span class="pageNum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>this point, first, a slight abrasion and then a complete wearing away of the bark
until the two raw surfaces end, it may be, in growing together. It is not improbable
that natural occurrences of this kind furnished man with his first notions of grafting.
</p>
<p>“Grafting by approach is an excellent method to apply whenever in the arrangement
of a fruit-tree’s branches there is a vacant space that needs filling. Regular distribution,
symmetry of arrangement, is a condition demanded if only to satisfy the eye, which
is always offended by disorder; but there is another and still more convincing reason
for this regularity. The more evenly a tree’s branches are distributed, so that each
shall receive an equal share of sap, sunlight, and heat, so much the more fruit will
it bear. Suppose, then, there is a lack of branches in some part. To fill this gap
and thus restore the tree’s symmetry, grafting by approach offers a ready means. From
a branch near the vacant space and itself sufficiently supplied with twigs or shoots,
one of these latter, of good length, is selected; then it is properly cut or gashed
and the gash is brought into contact with a similar gash at the point where it is
desired to start a new growth; and, finally, a ligature is applied to hold the two
parts together. As soon as coalescence is complete the graft is severed below the
point of union, and the lower section, after being straightened up again, is ready
to serve once more as branch to the limb that bears it. In this <span class="pageNum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>way, with no loss to themselves, the more abundant branches furnish offshoots to the
poorer ones.
</p>
<p>“Grafting by means of shoots or scions cut from the parent stock at the outset is
<span class="corr" id="xd31e2003" title="Source: analagous">analogous</span> to slipping. It consists in transplanting on to a new stock a shoot detached from
its mother branch. The most common method is cleft-grafting. It is done in the spring
when the buds begin to open. Shoots of the preceding year are chosen for grafts, care
being taken to select those that are vigorous and that have attained no later than
August the hard and woody condition necessary for resistance to the severities of
winter. One precaution at the very outset must be taken. When the graft is put in
place it will be of the utmost importance that it shall find in its new position nourishment
proportionate to its needs. It would infallibly perish if it should prove to be in
a more advanced state of vegetation than the stock selected to nourish it. The latter,
therefore, ought to be rather ahead of than behind the former in this respect. To
secure this result, between one and two months before the operation is to be carried
out it is well to cut the grafts and place them in the ground on the north side of
a wall, where they will remain quiescent while the branches to which they are to be
transferred will make progress and their sap will start.

<p>“We will suppose there is a worthless pear-tree in our garden, grown from a pip or
transplanted from its native wood, and we propose to make it bear <span class="pageNum" id="pb194">[<a href="#pb194">194</a>]</span>good pears. The course to pursue is as follows. We cut off entirely the upper part
of the wild pear tree, trimming the cut with our pruning-knife so that there are no
ragged edges, since these would not scar over readily and might become the seat of
a far-reaching decay. If the trunk is of moderate size and is to receive but one graft,
it is cut a little obliquely with a small level surface on the upper edge, as shown
in the picture. In the middle of this horizontal facet a split is made to the depth
of about six centimeters. That done, we take one of the grafts set aside as already
indicated, and we cut it so as to leave only two or three buds, of which the topmost
one should be at the tip of the branch. Then, just under the lowest bud we whittle
the end of the graft into the shape of a knife-blade, letting the bud stand just above
the back or dull edge of the blade. For greater stability when the graft is put in
place, a narrow inverted ledge is cut at the top of the blade on both sides. A glance
at the picture will show you all these little details. Finally, the graft is slipped
into the cleft of the stock, bark exactly meeting bark, wood meeting wood. The whole
is brought tightly together by binding, and the wounds are covered with grafting mastic,
which may be bought already prepared. If this mastic is lacking we can use what is
known in the country as Saint Fiacre’s ointment, a sort of paste made of clay, or
rather a mixture of clay and cows’ dung, <span class="pageNum" id="pb195">[<a href="#pb195">195</a>]</span>the fibrous nature of the latter preventing the former from cracking. A winding of
rags holds the ointment in place. Thus wound, the stump does not suffer from exposure
to the air, which would dry it up. In course of time the wounds cicatrize, and the
bark and wood of the graft coalesce with the bark and wood of the severed trunk. Finally
the buds of the graft, nourished by the stock, develop into branches and at the end
of a few years the top of the wild pear tree is replaced by that of a cultivated pear
tree bearing pears equal to those of the tree that furnished the graft.
</p>
<p>“The operation of cutting back a branch or trunk to receive the graft always promotes
the growth of numerous buds. What is to be done with the shoots that spring from these?
Evidently they must be suppressed, for they would appropriate, to no good end, the
sap intended for the graft. Nevertheless the suppression must be done cautiously.
Let us not forget that what primarily causes the sap to ascend is the evaporation
of moisture from the leaves. As long as the graft has not opened its buds and spread
its leaves, it is well to let the young shoots of the stock remain untouched. They
act as helpers, in that their foliage draws upward the juices extracted from the soil
by the roots; so that, far from having an injurious effect at this time, their presence
is most useful. But the day will come when the graft alone will suffice for this work
of pumping up the sap, and then it is best to get rid of these messmates which, of
heartier appetite than the graft, <span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>would soon starve it out. First the lower shoots of the stock are suppressed, then
gradually those higher up, care being taken not to destroy the top ones until the
graft has developed shoots two or three decimeters long.”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The part of a plant or tree above ground and the part under ground are mutually dependent,
the development of one implying a corresponding development in the other. If there
is a superabundance of foliage, the roots will be unable to furnish it sufficient
nourishment; on the other hand, if the roots are unduly vigorous, there will be too
much sap for the foliage—an excess of nourishment which, there being no use for it,
will encumber the plant and be injurious to it. Hence if the trunk to be grafted is
strong it must have several grafts, in order that the number of buds to be nourished
may be in right proportion to the number of nourishing roots.
</p>
<p>“To this end the trunk is cut, not obliquely as for a single graft, but horizontally.
Then it is split all the way across, following a line that passes through the central
pith, and two grafts are implanted in the cleft, one at each end. It is evident that
not more than two can be placed in the same cleft, because the bark of the graft must
of necessity come in contact with the bark of the stock to insure inter-communication
and coalescence between the sap-canals of the two. If the size of the stock requires
<span class="pageNum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span>more than two grafts, instead of splitting the trunk diametrically several times,
it is preferable to make lateral clefts which, leaving the center untouched, cause
less danger to the solidity of the stock.
</p>
<p>“Recourse can also be had to the following method, in which no clefts whatever are
called for, clefts being difficult to cicatrize when the wood is old. The grafts are
cut like the mouthpiece of a flute; that is to say, at the base half is taken off
lengthwise while the other half is left, but is whittled down, thinner and thinner
toward the end, much like a flute’s mouthpiece. Thus shaped, the grafts are inserted
between the wood and the bark of the stock, an operation facilitated by the flow of
sap in the spring, when the bark separates easily from the wood. If there is danger
of tearing the bark under the strain of the graft acting as a wedge, a slight incision
is made in the bark to give it the play it needs. In this way the circumference of
the stock receives the number of grafts deemed necessary. It only remains now to bind
the whole securely and cover the wounds with mastic. This method is called crown-grafting,
because the grafts are arranged in a crown on the circumference of the cross-section.
</p>
<p>“Grafting by buds corresponds to that variety of slipping in which buds, each one
by itself on a small fragment of the branch, are set into the ground. It consists
in transplanting on the stock a simple bud with the bit of bark that bears it. It
is the method most commonly employed. According to the time of year when the operation
is undertaken, the graft <span class="pageNum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>is called an active bud or a dormant bud. In the first case the grafting is done in
the spring, when nature is awaking from her winter’s sleep, so that the eye or bud
implanted in the stock coalesces with it and very soon develops into a young shoot.
In the second instance the bud is set in place some time in July or August, at the
period of the autumnal sap, so that it lies dormant or, in other words, remains stationary
during the following autumn and winter, after uniting with the stock.
</p>
<div class="figure p199width"><img src="images/p199.png" alt="Budding" width="297" height="299"><p class="figureHead">Budding</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“The implement here required is the grafting-knife, furnished at one end with a very
sharp blade, and at the other with a short spatula of bone or very hard wood. The
first thing to do is to remove the bud to be transplanted. On a branch in which the
sap is working we make with the grafting-knife a <span class="pageNum" id="pb200">[<a href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>transverse cut above the bud and another below; then, holding the branch in one hand
and the grafting-knife in the other, as the picture shows, we remove the strip of
bark lying between these two cuts and delimited laterally by the line <i>gg´g´´</i> and its opposite, in figure F. This strip, which we call the shield, is shown by
itself in H. The leaf that sheltered the bud in its axil has been removed, but the
base of the stem of this leaf has been left and will be useful later for taking hold
of the shield and handling it more conveniently. The shield must be cut away without
any tearing and in such a manner that no sap-wood is left clinging to the bark. The
latter must be perfectly intact, especially in its inner layers, the seat of vital
activities. Finally, the bud should have its proper complement of young, greenish
wood, which constitutes the germ, the very heart of the bud. Should this germ be removed
by unskilful manipulation, the bud would have to be thrown away, for the graft would
surely fail.
</p>
<p>“The next step is to make a double incision in the bark in the shape of a T, penetrating
as far as the wood but without injuring it. With the spatula of the grafting-knife
the two lips of the wound are raised a little while the bud with its shield is taken
up by the piece of leaf-stem attached to it and inserted between the bark and the
wood. All that now remains to be done is to draw the lips of the little wound together
and bind the whole with some sort of material sufficiently pliant and elastic not
to compress and finally strangle the bud as it develops. <span class="pageNum" id="pb201">[<a href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>A rush, a slender thong made of a long and flexible grass-blade, or, better still,
a piece of woolen yarn is well suited to the purpose. But if despite all precautions
the ligature should after a while prove too tight on account of the swelling of the
graft, it would be necessary to loosen it without delay. As soon as the graft has
‘taken,’ as we say, the young shoots starting out on the stock are gradually suppressed
in the cautious manner prescribed for cleft-grafting.
</p>
<p>“When the stock is too small to receive a bud in the usual manner, the following expedient
is resorted to. From a shoot of about the same size as the stock a rectangular strip
of bark with bud attached is cut with four incisions of the grafting-knife. This strip
is immediately laid upon the stock to serve as a pattern while the point of the knife
is passed all around it. In this way there is cut from the stock a strip of bark having
exactly the same shape and size as the pattern, which latter is thereupon inserted
in the vacant place and made fast there by a ligature. This process may not inappropriately
be called veneering.
</p>
<p>“In flute-grafting the bark both above and below the bud is cut transversely all around
the stem, and then another cut is made lengthwise between these two slashes. A cylinder
of bark may thus be peeled off in one piece. From the stock, which should match this
cylinder in size, a similar cylinder is removed and its place taken by the other one
bearing the bud we wish to transplant.”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They are eating dinner at the farm. A large platter of pork cutlets and beans is smoking
in the center of the table. Every one has been served. It is a pleasure to see these
good people eat, they have such hearty appetites. Jacques, the big ox-driver, is the
first to finish. He throws his bone away. Azor is there to seize it. He lies flat
on his stomach and takes the bone in his fore paws. Hear him bite on his hard pittance.
How it cracks! Let any one beware of teasing Azor now. An angry growl and a baring
of his four formidable canine teeth would warn the rash intruder to have done with
his joking at once, for if not—well, I will not be responsible for the consequences.
Azor is not a surly dog; far from it; but he is well within his rights when he brooks
no nonsense at his meals. He has done his duty most valiantly as a dog. Night before
last some wolves were prowling about the sheep-fold, and he drove them off. Let Azor
gnaw his bone in peace.
</p>
<p>Ha, there! The big tortoise-shell cat, Master Minet, is otherwise minded. He draws
near, hair erect, tail as large around as your arm, to try to frighten Azor and rob
him of his allowance. Azor, <span class="pageNum" id="pb203">[<a href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>without dropping the bone, gives a low growl and lifts one paw. That is enough, the
cat flees. So, my bold Minet, what were you after here? The bone is not for you; your
teeth are not strong enough to bite it. Go away! Martha is calling you to give you
some bread soaked in gravy. That will suit you better than a bone as hard as a stone.
</p>
<p>Ah, here come some more guests. The door stands open and in come the hens from the
poultry-yard. <i>Tap, tap, tap, tap</i>; they peck the crumbs fallen from the table. Azor has no use for such diet—tiny morsels
much too small for him; nor does the cat want them either, they are too floury. But
the hens feast on them.
</p>
<p>And all, human beings, dog, cat, hens, dine at the same time; only each must make
the best of what the others cannot use. Azor is content with the bone that big Jacques
threw away; the cat is satisfied with a little bread soaked in gravy, a dish quite
inadequate to Azor’s needs; the hens pick up the crumbs disdained by Jacques, Azor,
and the cat. Martha, it seems, had prepared dinner only for the farm people, and behold,
by utilizing the scraps that are worthless to some, many others join in the midday
meal. From the scraps disdained by man the dog will gain strength to defend the flock;
from those rejected by the dog the cat will acquire keen eyesight and sharp claws
to see and to seize the mouse; from what is of no value to the cat the hens will make
eggs; and everything, absolutely everything, will go to the profit of the farm.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Agriculture in its turn,” remarked Uncle Paul, turning to account this homely illustration
in domestic economy, “prepares dinner for the crops in its own peculiar manner. It
spreads the ground with manure, that fertile dressing so relished by growing plants.
The table is set, or in other words the field is ready, well plowed and harrowed,
and well manured. Whom shall we call first to the table, for it is plain we cannot
invite all at once. Whom shall we call first? It shall be wheat, let us say, a plant
with tastes hard to please, but one that in return gives us bread. So wheat is sown.
In this soil, full of all sorts of good things, it cannot fail to thrive, however
unfavorable the season may be. It will select what suits it best and leave the rest.
</p>
<p>“Now that is done. The harvest is in, and it handsomely comes up to our hopes. The
wheat has converted into magnificent grain the fertilizer put into the ground. Out
of decay it has created nourishment. Surely it has well acquitted itself of its charge.
It has made a clean sweep: all that could be turned into wheat it has appropriated,
and there remains nothing further to be done. What would happen, then, if wheat were
sown again in the same field? Exactly the same thing that would happen to Simon if
he had nothing to eat but the bone that Jacques threw away. He would die of hunger.
Simon must have man’s food, wheat must have wheat’s food. So if the first crop has
exhausted the supply of material for making wheat, how can you expect to raise a second
crop? Evidently that is asking <span class="pageNum" id="pb205">[<a href="#pb205">205</a>]</span>the impossible; it is running the risk of reaping only a very mediocre harvest or
even none at all. Therefore it is the rule not to sow wheat twice in succession in
the same field. And what is true of wheat is true also of all other crops. Where a
plant has prospered one year, the same plant will not do well the second year, because
the ingredients required by this plant are more or less exhausted. It is foolish to
invite guests to a table that is stripped bare.
</p>
<p>“If the table were spread again, if more fertilizer were added to the soil, that would
be quite a different matter, and wheat would grow as well as it did the first time.
But such a procedure would be bad management, for the very utmost should be made of
one meal. Before further expenditure in the way of fertilizer let us exhaust the virtue
of the fertilizer already applied. Azor dined well on what Jacques discarded; the
hens were well fed with what Azor and the cat left. Let us take an example from this
succession of eaters who utilize each in his own way the remnants worthless to the
others. The wheat has exhausted, or nearly exhausted, all that is suitable for wheat;
but just as Jacques the ox-driver left the bone, it has left in the soil a good many
ingredients that make excellent food for other crops. In order, therefore, to utilize
to the last ounce the first spreading of fertilizer, we must invite to the repast
a guest of different tastes. This guest may be, for example, the potato. In soil that
would have furnished but starvation diet for wheat the potato <span class="pageNum" id="pb206">[<a href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>will find quite enough to live on, its tastes not being the same as the cereal’s.
</p>
<p>“Thus we have two successive crops for one coating of manure: we have sacks of potatoes
with no additional outlay in fertilizer. Is that all? Not yet. After the wheat and
the potatoes there is, to be sure, but meager nourishment left in the upper layer
of the soil; but in the lower layers there remains the part of the fertilizer that
the rain has washed down and dissolved and that the short roots of the preceding crops
could not reach. To utilize this underlying matter and bring it up again to the surface
in the form of forage let us now sow a plant with vigorous roots, such as clover,
sainfoin, or, still better, lucerne, which will penetrate deeper. And so we get our
third crop.
</p>
<p>“After clover we can try a fourth crop, of a different kind; but it is evident that
as the guests succeed one another at the same table the remnants become more and more
scanty and difficult to utilize. Accordingly we must choose a hardy plant and one
that is content with little. Finally a time will come, and at no very distant date,
when the board will be bare: the coating of manure will have given up its last particle
of nutritious matter. Then the table must be garnished afresh, the field fertilized
anew before beginning again with the same crops or attempting others. Let us demand
no more. You understand, my young friends, that in order to utilize to the utmost
this precious substance that gives us every kind of food, such as bread, vegetables,
forage, meat, <span class="pageNum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>fruit, dairy products—to make the very best use of this we must, instead of raising
the same crop in the same field year after year, adopt the plan of varying our crops,
changing from one of one kind to another of a different character, so that what earlier
plantings have left in the soil may be turned to account by later ones. This succession
of different sorts of farm produce is called rotation of crops.”

<h2 class="main">ROTATION OF CROPS</h2>
<h2 class="sub">(<i>Continued</i>)</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“When soil is spoken of as worn out and needing rest, the speaker uses a figure of
speech meaning that the soil has been exhausted by the crops it has borne. The crops
do indeed take from the land a great quantity of substances necessary for plant-life;
and when these substances are no longer present in sufficient amount, the soil refuses
to produce; it is exhausted. To restore its original fertility would require a large
outlay in fertilizer and hence it is often more advantageous to accomplish this object
by one of the following methods.
</p>
<p>“Sometimes the land is allowed to lie fallow; that is to say, it is left to itself
without any care whatever for whole years. Weeds spring up freely, and at the same
time water, air, and frost act on the soil, disintegrating and mellowing it and inducing
the formation of certain substances necessary to vegetation. The weeds are converted
into mold, and finally the land, rested and recuperated, is ready to bear a new crop.
Restoration by this process is very slow, taking several years, and hence it is customary
to shorten the period of waiting by working the soil and even manuring it, although
it may not <span class="pageNum" id="pb209">[<a href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>yet be the intention to sow any seed. In these circumstances the land is called fallow
land.
</p>
<p>“There is, however, one way to obtain an uninterrupted succession of crops from the
same land unless the soil is very poor. All plants derive their nourishment from the
soil and the atmosphere; but some take more from the atmosphere, others from the soil.
The plants that get their sustenance chiefly from the air are those that have luxuriant
foliage. The potato is one of these. You know that it is through their leaves that
plants obtain the carbonic acid gas diffused in the air. The greater the spread of
foliage, the more abundant will this absorption be. The plants that depend almost
wholly on the soil are those with only a few small, slender leaves, thus taking but
little carbonic acid gas from the air. Such is wheat.
</p>
<p>“Moreover, from the potato plant we take only the tubers, which form but a small part
of the whole, and we turn under the stalks and leaves, which are thereupon converted
into humus. Thus the potato has the property of enriching the soil at the expense
of the atmosphere, and it gives back more than it takes. It is, then, one of the enriching
rather than impoverishing plants in respect to its action on the soil. Cereals, on
the contrary, are utilized by the harvester both as to seed and haulm, nothing but
the meager roots being left in the ground; and as, on account of their very scanty
foliage, cereals derive almost their entire sustenance from the soil, they take from
it much more than they give back to it. <span class="pageNum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>They accordingly belong to the class of plants that impoverish rather than enrich
the soil in which they grow.
</p>
<p>“It is impossible, thus, except by a ruinous expenditure of fertilizer, to raise a
crop of grain every year on the same land. But if we should let potatoes succeed wheat,
and wheat succeed potatoes, what would be the result? The latter crop, deriving a
large part of its nourishment from the air, would flourish in soil comparatively exhausted
by wheat; and on having its leaves and stalks turned under it would give back to the
soil a part of its former fertility. Wheat could then be successfully raised again
on the same land.
</p>
<p>“This practice of raising successively on the same land different crops as little
harmful to one another as possible and capable of utilizing to the utmost the dressing
put on to the land, is nothing but that very rotation of crops that I have already
told you something about. Its purpose is to economize fertilizer and at the same time
to secure an uninterrupted succession of crops. The underlying principle consists
in making an enriching plant succeed an impoverishing one; that is to say, a plant
with luxuriant foliage is made to succeed one with scanty foliage. The chief enriching
plants are clover, lucerne, sainfoin, potatoes, turnips, and beets. Cereals, on the
contrary, are all impoverishing plants. It is a general custom to raise on the same
land a more or less extended series of different crops, the series running four, five,
or six years, or <span class="pageNum" id="pb211">[<a href="#pb211">211</a>]</span>even longer, after which it begins over again in the same order. This rotation of
crops is designated according to the number of years the series covers, as for instance
a five-year or a six-year rotation. A six-year rotation might run, we will say, somewhat
as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1st year—potatoes—enriching crop.
</li>
<li>2nd year—wheat—impoverishing crop.
</li>
<li>3rd year—clover—enriching crop.
</li>
<li>4th year—wheat—impoverishing crop.
</li>
<li>5th year—sainfoin—enriching crop.
</li>
<li>6th year—oats—impoverishing crop.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>“Let us examine in detail this series that we have taken as an example. The first
year the soil is thoroughly manured. One of the effects of manuring is to start a
great crop of weeds that would infest the land and impoverish the crop were they not
carefully removed. Hence the necessity of weeding. To weed a piece of ground is to
destroy the weeds either by hand or with some implement. But it is not every crop
that admits of weeding: the plants must be a certain distance apart, as otherwise
they will be trampled under foot, cut off, or uprooted in the weeding process. Wheat
cannot be weeded, its stalks are too close together; but potatoes are far enough apart
for weeding without difficulty. Now, weeding destroys all useless, injurious grasses
and other unwelcome intruders; their future reappearance is prevented by pulling them
up before their seeds <span class="pageNum" id="pb212">[<a href="#pb212">212</a>]</span>ripen, and thus at last the ground is cleaned and made ready for a choice crop. This
will explain to you the great advantage of letting the potato or some other crop that
can be weeded take precedence of the cereals.
</p>
<p>“The second year comes wheat. Cleaned by the tillage that has gone before, the ground
is no longer covered with grass and weeds. Nor does it need fresh manure, for if the
potatoes have consumed certain elements in the soil, these are not exactly the same
that wheat requires; and, furthermore, the dead plants, turned under and reduced to
vegetable mold, compensate by what they have derived from the atmosphere for what
the tubers may have taken from the soil. Wheat is therefore just the crop to raise
now.
</p>
<p>“But it would be much against one’s interest to exact from the soil another crop of
wheat the third year. Exhausted by the grain it has just produced, the soil would
yield but a scanty harvest unless it were freshly manured, a process that would make
of the whole operation, not a piece of farming, but an example of gardening, and would
also entail too great expense. For that reason the third year is devoted to the raising
of an enriching crop, such as clover. After furnishing a supply of fodder, what is
left of the clover is turned under, and all its remnants of roots, stems, and leaves
are reduced to mold, which renders the soil fit for another wheat harvest the fourth
year. A third enriching crop to be turned under after the final mowing, is likewise
<span class="pageNum" id="pb213">[<a href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>needed for the fifth year; and this crop may be sainfoin. At the end of the series
comes another cereal, oats, for example. The rotation is now complete, and the program
begins all over again.
</p>
<p>“Crop-rotation is capable of innumerable variations, and the series may be longer
or shorter, but there should be the slightest possible departure from the rule that
a cereal crop ought always to be preceded by some crop that enriches the soil.”

<p class="first">“In the bottom of a flower-pot you will find a small round hole. Over this hole it
is customary to lay a bit of broken tile, and on this, if the plant to occupy the
pot is delicate, a few small pebbles. This done, the pot is filled with vegetable
mold. Why this hole, this bit of tile, these pebbles? That is what we are now about
to consider.
</p>
<p>“Water is absolutely indispensable to plants, since it is the medium that dissolves
the various nutritive ingredients of the soil and thus renders them capable of assimilation
by the roots. Accordingly the soil penetrated by these roots must be constantly supplied
with sufficient moisture either by rainfall or by artificial irrigation. But air is
not less indispensable. It disinfects the soil and by causing slow combustion of the
humus gives rise to a slight but uninterrupted liberation of carbonic acid gas, one
of the nutritive substances required by vegetation. Should the roots be cut off from
this life-giving agency, they would languish and finally decay. Thus it is that if
vegetation is to thrive the soil in which it grows must have at the same time both
air and water. But if the bottom of the flower-pot has no opening, or if its opening
is stopped up, <span class="pageNum" id="pb215">[<a href="#pb215">215</a>]</span>the water from the watering-can will not flow through, nor will there be any air admitted
from below, and for lack of this the roots will decay. On the other hand, if the water,
after saturating the earth, runs out freely by the hole in the bottom of the pot,
the damp soil will become a sort of sponge to which the air will have access from
all sides, and the plant will thrive.
</p>
<p>“This reasoning applies to the most extensive agricultural operations as well as to
the care of a potted plant. After water has soaked into the ground it should find
some channel to carry it off; otherwise the roots will decay for want of air. That
is why clayey soils, which retain water when they are once saturated, are unsuited
to agriculture, while light soils, having sand mixed with the clay and thus readily
allowing the water to drain off, are well adapted to it. For the same reason, again,
a sandy subsoil accelerates vegetation, and a clayey subsoil retards it. A sandy subsoil
offers the same advantage as a flower-pot open at the bottom, whereas a clayey subsoil
is like a flower-pot closed at the bottom. In the first case the surplus of water
drains off and the air has free access; in the second the superabundant moisture finds
no outlet and the air cannot reach the roots.
</p>
<p>“Now let us suppose we have a marshy soil to deal with. Because of the stagnant water
either on the surface or a little below it nothing can grow on this piece of ground
except rushes or other hardy plants designed by nature for this kind of soil. Accordingly
<span class="pageNum" id="pb216">[<a href="#pb216">216</a>]</span>we proceed to dig a number of small ditches, of a depth somewhat greater than that
attained by plant-roots, and we fill the bottom of these ditches with small stones,
on which we finally throw back the earth we have removed. These underground ditches
are suitably inclined, and all empty at the lower end into a main canal. The water
saturating the soil collects in these ditches, filters through the layer of pebbles,
and empties into the main canal, which carries it off to some river or other stream.
Our marshy soil is now like the potful of earth with a hole at the bottom, the bit
of broken tile, and layer of little pebbles: the air has free access and brings fertility
with it. This operation of ours is called drainage, a word formed from ‘drain,’ which
is both a verb and a noun. In the latter sense we apply it to the narrow ditch dug
for carrying off superfluous water.
</p>
<p>“A drainage system like that just described is the simplest possible, but there is
one serious objection to it: the layer of small stones soon becomes clogged with soil
washed down by the water, and the latter can no longer run off. Hence it is customary
to use fagots instead of stones, since they offer less obstruction. But still better
results are obtained with earthenware conduits laid in the ditches. Sometimes these
conduits take the form of drain-tiles such as are used on roofs, and they rest on
sills or ground-pieces of the same material; or, again, they may be tubular in form,
the successive sections loosely fitted together so that the water <span class="pageNum" id="pb217">[<a href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>to be carried off may enter where the sections join.
</p>
<p>“The effect of drainage is not merely to carry off the superfluous water and thus
promote the aëration of the soil to the depth reached by the roots; it also keeps
the soil cool and moist by the constant presence of water in the drainage ditches
or pipes. When a heap of sand is watered at its base, the moisture is seen to mount
higher and higher until it reaches the top. In like manner the water collected in
our drainage ditches soaks into the upper soil in a dry time and thus reaches the
roots of plants growing there, so that water which is superfluous or even harmful
at certain periods is held in reserve and gradually distributed at the right moment.
</p>
<p>“Another advantage of a drainage system is that it prevents that cooling of the soil
which would result from prolonged evaporation. In taking the form of vapor water chills
the objects that help to promote the evaporation. For this reason we feel a decided
chill on emerging from a bath; the film of moisture that covered us is passing off
in vaporous form. Similarly a constant evaporation at the surface of a water-soaked
tract of land chills the ground and we have a cold soil. But if the water is carried
off by proper drainage, evaporation ceases and there is no further chilling of the
surface soil. Now, a high temperature is always favorable to vegetation.
</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd31e2151" title="Not in source">“</span>Draining is so beneficial that it is not confined to marshy ground, which without
it would be quite unproductive, but is applied also to ordinary arable <span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>land. Wherever the soil is too clayey, or even where the surface soil is good but
the subsoil clayey, rain-water cannot drain off readily and the ground remains soggy
and cold. Eventually, however, it dries up, but there being no way for the air to
permeate the soil, the latter is left hard and unyielding, so that the roots are by
turns drowned in liquid mud and held fast in a tenacious paste that has been baked
by the sun. Drainage overcomes these difficulties, and consequently all rich soils
that hold rain-water for some time before infiltration are much improved by being
properly drained.”

<h2 class="main">PARING AND BURNING</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“You see that man over there on the hillside,” said Uncle Paul, pointing to a laborer
who, with a large hoe, was paring the ground, so to speak, by shaving off great squares
of earth covered with grass and weeds and shrubs. “You see how he stands those pieces
up, either in pairs, back to back, or one at a time, so bent or vaulted that they
will stay upright by themselves. Thus the air is allowed to circulate and dry them
rapidly. If we come back in a few days, after sun and air have done their work and
the drying process is complete, we shall find our man there again at his work; and
we shall see how he piles up the turf with the earthy side upward and outward. In
the middle of the pile he leaves a cavity which he fills with brushwood and dry leaves.
Then he sets fire to the whole. A second pile is constructed in the same manner and
likewise set on fire. Soon the entire hillside is covered with a great number of these
small furnaces, burning slowly and sending out long trails of smoke. In a few days,
three or four at most, the fires burn themselves out, and then, as soon as all the
piles are cold, the mixture of ashes and calcined earth is spread over the ground
with a shovel. This agricultural <span class="pageNum" id="pb220">[<a href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>operation is known as paring and burning, and is carried out for the purpose of rendering
arable a tract of land not yet under cultivation and still covered with wild vegetation.
</p>
<p>“The operation of paring and burning produces two effects, one with reference to the
clay in the soil, the other having to do with the ashes left from the burning of the
weeds. Clay, as you know, is a tenacious, binding substance, impervious to both air
and water. Consequently a soil that is too clayey is unfavorable for vegetation, furnishing
the roots with insufficient air and moisture. Now, when clay is heated to a high temperature,
it acquires very different properties: it no longer makes paste by the addition of
water, but is porous, permeable, and readily admits air and water. The paring-and-burning
process, therefore, improves an argillaceous soil by calcining the clay and rendering
it permeable. That is as much as to say that if paring and burning are beneficial
to heavy or clayey soils, they are, on the other hand, harmful to those that are light
or sandy.
</p>
<p>“Finally, the operation just described affects the soil through the ashes of the burnt
weeds. After the combustion of all vegetable matter there remains an earthy powder
or ash comprising the mineral substances contained in that vegetable matter, substances
unchanged by combustion because of their great resistance to heat. The most important
of these is potash. All the ingredients that once belonged to the burnt plants are
evidently adapted to <span class="pageNum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>the formation of new plants. The ashes, then, of the weeds consumed in the process
of paring and burning will be very useful to the plants about to be raised on the
land that has been burnt over. By the burning, however, it is impossible to turn to
account all that the weeds contained: what escapes in the form of smoke is so much
lost. Hence care should be taken not to carry combustion too far. In this connection
the calcined clay renders still another service. By becoming porous through calcination
its nature is altered so that it can absorb and retain the gaseous products of combustion
and thus save just so much waste. But if a soil lacks clay, paring and burning are
harmful, and it is better simply to turn the weeds under, whereupon they will be converted
into mold instead of being dissipated in the atmosphere as smoke.
</p>
<p>“Ashes other than those resulting from paring and burning are also used as an agricultural
fertilizer, though they are rarely put to this use just as they are, because the contained
potash, a highly valuable substance, is first extracted by leaching. After this process
the ashes are called buck-ashes. They contain silica and also carbonate and phosphate
of lime, all in a condition most favorable for assimilation by plants. Of less strength
than ordinary ashes, leached ashes nevertheless produce good results, especially on
clayey soil. Coal ashes, too, it should be added, serve to lighten a heavy soil since
they contain a large proportion of calcined clay.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The subject of ashes leads us naturally to that of soot, a substance composed of
vegetable matter incompletely decomposed by heat and containing ammonia, which renders
it highly efficacious as a fertilizer. It is applied to young plants, giving them
an increased vigor of growth. By its acrid quality, moreover, it is excellent as a
protection against insects that attack vegetation.”

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XLIV</h2>
<h2 class="main">WINE-MAKING</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“When wine is heated, there is first an escape of an inflammable vapor that burns
with a bluish flame. A person needs only to have seen once this preparation of hot
wine to recall that curious flame flickering over the boiling liquid and darting up
little blue tongues. Now, this inflammable vapor comes from alcohol, a fluid substance
that gives to wine its peculiar properties and is hence sometimes called spirits of
wine. There are, then, in wine two distinct liquids, one easily reducible to vapor
and called alcohol, the other slower to vaporize and recognizable as water. This does
not mean that the wine has been watered: the water in question is not there as the
result of fraud; it belongs naturally to the wine and comes from grapes just as alcohol
does. Wine is therefore a natural mixture of a small proportion of alcohol with a
great quantity of water. In our ordinary wines the proportion of alcohol for each
hundred quarts of liquid varies from nine to fourteen quarts.
</p>
<p>“Wine is made from the juice of grapes. This juice, as it is pressed out of the sweet
grapes, has none of the taste or smell peculiar to wine, for it does not yet contain
any alcohol; but it does have an <span class="pageNum" id="pb224">[<a href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>agreeably sweet taste, the same taste that makes grapes so desirable a fruit for the
table. This pleasant flavor is due to a sort of sugar present in the grapes. Examine
carefully a handful of raisins such as you buy at the grocer’s: you will detect on
their surface, certain tiny white grains that crunch under the teeth and have a sweet
savor. Those grains are little particles of sugar that have collected on the outside
of the grapes during the process of drying. Grapes, then, must contain sugar.
</p>
<p>“Well now, this sugar is exactly what causes the formation of alcohol. What is sugar
in the fresh juice of grapes is alcohol in the same juice after it has fermented and
turned to wine. Let us consider briefly how this change comes about.
</p>
<p>“The vintage is first of all subjected to a process of treading by men who trample
on the grapes in large vats, after which the resulting mixture of juice and skins
is left to ‘work,’ as we say. Before long this liquid mush begins to heat of its own
accord, and presently there sets in a sort of boiling which liberates big bubbles
of gas as if there were a fire underneath. This working process is called fermentation,
and its seat is in the sugar of the grape-juice. Little by little the sugar decomposes,
splits apart as we might say, into two substances very different from each other and
also very different from the sugar whence they came. Of these two substances one is
alcohol; the other is a gas already known to us—carbonic acid, the same gas that plants
feed on and that animals give forth in breathing; <span class="pageNum" id="pb225">[<a href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>the same, finally, as that produced by burning coal. The alcohol remains in the liquid,
which thus gradually loses its original sweet taste and acquires instead a vinous
flavor. The gas, on the contrary, works its way to the surface, agitating the mass
with a sort of tumultuous movement like that of boiling water, and is dissipated in
the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>“Let us bear in mind that carbonic acid gas is as invisible as the air itself, that
it has no odor, no color, and finally that it kills quickly if inhaled in any considerable
quantity. That explains the danger lurking in a wine-vat during fermentation, or even
in a wine-cellar that lacks sufficient ventilation to carry off the perilous gas.
No one should enter such places without holding before one a lighted taper at the
end of a long stick. While the taper continues to burn in the usual manner, one can
proceed without fear: there is no carbonic acid gas present. But if the flame becomes
dim, gets smaller and smaller, and finally goes out altogether, one must beat a hasty
retreat, for the extinction of the taper is a sure sign of the presence of carbonic
acid gas, and further advance would mean exposing oneself to imminent death.
</p>
<p>“But to return to the subject of wine-making, we were saying that the sugar which
imparts its sweet taste to the must (that is, the unfermented grape-juice) changes
its nature and divides into two parts: alcohol, which remains in the liquid and turns
it to wine, and carbonic acid gas, which is dissipated in the atmosphere. When this
process is <span class="pageNum" id="pb226">[<a href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>finished the wine is drawn off, leaving behind the residuum of skins and pips. The
final product is thus composed of a large quantity of water from the grapes themselves,
a small quantity of alcohol from the sugar which has undergone the chemical change
just described, and, finally, a coloring substance furnished by the dark grape-skins.
</p>
<p>“White wine is made from white grapes, which have skins with no coloring matter; but
it can very well be made from dark grapes, colored though they are. The secret consists
simply in this: the crushed grapes are pressed before fermentation begins. In this
way the juice is separated from the skins, and, these latter being removed, the wine
will be white even with dark grapes. In short, the coloring matter in grapes which
gives its hue to red wine is contained solely in the skins; and furthermore it is
insoluble in water, but easily soluble in alcohol. Hence it is only after fermentation
has made some progress that the liquid becomes colored by the dissolving of the coloring
matter through the agency of the alcohol that has been generated. Accordingly, if
the skins are removed before the juice ferments and generates alcohol, the wine remains
white, since it no longer contains any coloring matter to dissolve.
</p>
<p>“Some wines force out the corks from their bottles and are covered with foam on being
poured into glasses. These are foamy wines, and to produce them the bottling must
be done before fermentation is finished. The carbonic acid gas then continues to form,
but as it finds no way of escape since the <span class="pageNum" id="pb227">[<a href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>bottle is tightly corked, it dissolves in the liquid and accumulates there, though
all the while endeavoring to free itself; and that is what makes the cork pop with
a sharp report when the string that holds it down is cut; that is what causes the
wine to rush foaming out of the bottle; and, finally, that is what gives the bead
to a glass of wine and makes a slight crackling sound as the bubbles burst on the
surface.
</p>
<p>“Foamy wine has a pungent but agreeable taste owing to the carbonic acid it contains.
We drink, dispersed through the liquid, the same gas as would kill us if freely inhaled;
but it has no terrors except when thus inhaled. Mixed with our drinks, it imparts
to them a slightly tart flavor, harmless and even salubrious, since it aids digestion.
There is carbonic acid gas in nearly all water that we drink, and it is in fact by
reason of this gas that water is able to hold in solution the small proportion of
stony matter that contributes toward the formation of our bones. It is to this gas,
finally, that effervescent lemonade, cider, beer, and Seltzer water owe their pungency
and their foam.”

<h2 class="main">THE STAG-BEETLE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“One of the joys of your time of life, I am sure,” resumed Uncle Paul, as he and his
hearers seated themselves in the shade of an old oak tree amid the humming and whirring
of insect life all about them, “is the study of the little creatures of field and
farm and forest, so interesting in their mode of life, so varied in their forms and
colors. You chase the splendid butterfly from flower to flower, you take up the cockchafer
and put it on a bed of fresh leaves, with a straw you drive the cricket from its hole.
The insect that amuses you can also instruct you. In our modest studies let us now
have a little talk on this subject.
</p>
<p>“What is this tiny creature with the stout coat-of-mail of chestnut color? Its large
head, showing parallel folds that might have been carved by a sculptor’s hand, is
armed with two branching nippers which open like a pair of tongs and then close, mangling
between their teeth the finger they have seized. Woe to the giddy-pate that lets himself
be caught by them! The trap closes tighter and tighter and never lets go.
</p>
<p>“But, vigorous as are its mandibles, the insect is not one to be afraid of, provided
only you look <span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>out for those nippers. For all its threatening aspect, it is at bottom a peaceful
creature. Catch it by one leg and it will fly round and round like the June-bug. It
is called the stag-beetle, a name that explains itself, for it has branching mandibles
resembling a stag’s horns, and it belongs to the family of beetles. Put the two words
together and you have ‘stag-beetle.’
</p>
<p>“The singular creature has not always been as we see it to-day. In its youth, not
later than last year, it had neither its present mandibles nor its six legs nor its
chestnut-colored coat-of-mail. In fact, its form had nothing in common with what we
now behold. Then it was a big, fat worm, with fine white skin, crawling on legs so
small and feeble as hardly to deserve mention.
</p>
<div class="figure floatRight p229width"><img src="images/p229.png" alt="Stag-beetle" width="111" height="192"><p class="figureHead">Stag-beetle</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“The whole animal consisted of little more than a crawling stomach unprovided with
any protection. The head alone was fortified with a substantial skull of horn, and
it also bore, one on the right side of the mouth, the other on the left, two short
but strong teeth adapted to cutting in pieces the wood of the oak, its sole nourishment.
</p>
<p>“Such a worm, entirely naked, evidently cannot live in the open air, where the thousand
little roughnesses of the ground would be continually wounding its delicate skin.
It must have a safe shelter that it need not leave until it has become the well-armored
insect we now see. The grub of the stag-beetle does <span class="pageNum" id="pb230">[<a href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>in fact live inside the oak, which affords it at once food and lodging. There, in
the depths of the tree-trunk, is its inviolable retreat.
</p>
<p>“With its two teeth, as hard and sharp as a carpenter’s tool, it cuts away, patiently,
bit by bit, the fresh wood imbued with sap. Each fragment thus detached is a mouthful
for the worm’s nourishment; but as it is by no means a rich diet there must be a good
deal of it to furnish enough nutriment. Therefore the gnawing goes on without cessation,
in all directions, with a corresponding enlargement of the domicile, which soon becomes
a labyrinth of galleries that go up and down and cross one another, penetrate farther
into the trunk or approach the surface, at the pleasure of the occupant, whose choice
is determined by its taste for morsels lying in this or that direction.
</p>
<p>“For three or four years this is the worm’s mode of life. To make itself big and fat
is its sole business, and to this it devotes itself with vigor. I leave you to imagine
what must become of an oak tree worked by a dozen of these gnawing creatures. Under
the bark, which is almost intact, the trunk is one vast wound, perforated with galleries
that are themselves littered with wormhole dust, and oozing with a brown juice that
smells like a tannery. Unless the forester applies a remedy, and that speedily, the
enormous oak will be ruined. Leaving this care to his charge, let us go on with our
story.
</p>
<p>“When it has become big enough and fat enough, after at least three years of continual
feasting, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb231">[<a href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>worm prepares to change its form. Near the surface, that its future exit may be the
easier, the little creature hollows out a sufficiently large oval chamber and lines
it with a sort of wadding made of the finest fibers of the wood. Thus the tender flesh
of the rejuvenated insect will be protected from all rude outer contact.
</p>
<p>“These precautions taken, the worm undergoes its transfiguration: it splits open all
down the back, strips off its skin, throws it away like a discarded garment, and is
born a second time, as one might say, but under a totally different form. It is no
longer a worm—far from it—but it is not yet a stag-beetle, although the outlines of
the latter are already discernible.
</p>
<p>“The creature is quite motionless, as if dead. The legs, neatly folded over the stomach,
are as transparent as crystals; the nippers are pressed close to the breast; the wings,
not yet expanded, have the appearance of a short scarf encircling the flanks; and
the whole is swathed in swaddling-clothes finer in texture than an onion skin. The
entire organism is wrapped in a repose so profound that one might think all life extinct.
It is white or crystalline in appearance, and so tender that a mere nothing will wound
it. The coarse worm of the beginning has been succeeded by this most delicate of creatures.
</p>
<p>“Out of the material amassed by the wood-gnawer’s voracious appetite there is created
an entirely new being. The flesh, at first nearly fluid, slowly <span class="pageNum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>acquires consistency; the skin hardens, assumes a chestnut hue, takes on the firmness
of horn; in fact, when the warm season returns again the insect wakes up from that
deep sleep, not of death, but nevertheless very much like it. The creature moves,
tears apart the swathing bands under which its rebirth has taken place, strips off
these wrappings, and here at last we have the insect in its full perfection. Behold
the stag-beetle!
</p>
<p>“It comes out from its native oak, spreads its wings in flight under cover of the
foliage, and settles down, now on this tree, now on that, in the rays of the sun.
The freedom of the open air and the enjoyment of the light of day constitute its supreme
felicity for which it has been preparing during the three or four years of constant
toil in the dark galleries of an old oak.
</p>
<p>“Thenceforth it grows no larger. Just as it was on emerging from its cell, so it will
remain to the end, without the least increase either in weight or in bulk. Thus it
leads a very staid existence. In its grub state the famished creature gnawed wood
night and day; its life was a perpetual digestion. Now, on the contrary, all that
it needs in the way of sustenance is an occasional sip of the sweetened sap oozing
from the bark of the tree.
</p>
<p>“But its days of idle delight are numbered; it has scarcely a couple of months to
spend joyously among the oak trees. Then it lays its eggs, one by one, in the crevices
of tree-trunks, to propagate its kind; and, that done, it very soon dies. It has played
its <span class="pageNum" id="pb233">[<a href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>part. From those eggs will come forth worms which will patiently work their way into
the wood, hollow out galleries there in their turn, and begin all over again the very
sort of existence led by their fore-fathers.
</p>
<p>“The greater number of insects have the same life-history as the stag-beetle: they
pass through different stages before taking on their final form. All without exception,
the smallest as well as the largest, come from eggs deposited by the mother in chosen
places where the needed nourishment, so variable in different species, is easy to
find.
</p>
<p>“From the egg emerges, not the finished insect with all its distinctive traits, but
a provisional creature bearing, very often, no resemblance to the parent or to the
matured offspring of that parent. This initial form we called a worm in speaking of
the stag-beetle, and the name is in that instance appropriate; but in a multitude
of cases it would be incorrect, having no agreement with the creature’s appearance.
We then call it a larva.
</p>
<p>“The larva is therefore the insect under the form it presents on emerging from the
egg. Its continuance in this form is longer than in that of the finally perfected
creature. The larva of the stag-beetle remains a larva for three or four years, whereas
the beetle itself lives but a couple of months. The sole occupation of this grub is
eating, continual eating, that it may grow fat and store up supplies enough to carry
it through its subsequent transformations.
</p>
<p>“Having attained sufficient size, the larva constructs <span class="pageNum" id="pb234">[<a href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>a retreat for itself, hollows out a little cell, and spins a cocoon where in perfect
quiet the delicate task of transformation will be undertaken. It strips off its skin
and becomes an inert, formative body known as a nymph.
</p>
<p>“Finally, the nymph, having arrived at the right degree of maturity, casts off its
wrappings and reveals itself as transformed into a perfect insect. It lays its eggs,
and the same succession of changes is again repeated. The egg, the larva, the nymph,
the perfect insect—there you have the four stages of the insect’s life. These changes
of form are called metamorphoses.”

rarely strays beyond the regions bordering on the Mediterranean. It belongs to the
band of scavengers, a group of handsome insects which, feeding on ordure, are charged
with the sanitation of the greensward defiled by grazing herds.
</p>
<p>“Its favorite dish is the dung of horses and mules. With the toothed edges of its
head it rummages in the dung; with its wide, serrate fore legs it cuts up this material,
kneads it, and molds it into a ball about as large as an apricot. This done, the next
thing is to seek out some quiet retreat far from the hubbub of its fellows who have
been drawn to the spot for as much as a kilometer round about by the odor; and of

is thus dragged a long distance over the sand, across the greensward, and over ruts.
Perhaps the scarabs find their bread at first not sufficiently compact, and seek to
give it consistency by rolling it on the ground. Every one according to his fancy.
</p>
<p>“At last a favorable spot is selected in a sandy tract. One of the two proprietors
hollows out in all haste a dining-room, while the other stands guard without over
the globular treasure, ready to defend it stoutly against any chance marauder. As
soon as the dining-room is ready the provisions are stored away there, after which
the two colleagues shut themselves up in their domicile, safe from unwelcome visitors,
closing their door with sand. So there they are at table, with their heap of victuals
in front of them; and now for a good feast! When the board is bare again, the two
banqueters leave their dugout to gather together a new globule and resume their feasting.
</p>
<p>“The scarab is not found everywhere, the more’s the pity, for its manner of life is
very curious to watch. Wanting this manufacturer of globules, we nevertheless do have
everywhere other scavengers which work in somewhat similar fashion. Out of ordure
they put together little balls of the size of a cherry, and sometimes they roll away
their plunder, as does the scarab, bury it in the ground, and there <span class="pageNum" id="pb237">[<a href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>regale themselves on it. Their trade of making these little balls or pills has given
them the expressive name of pill-mixers.
</p>
<p>“Let us pass on to other kinds. This one, for example, is called the calosoma. By
reason of the elegance of its form and the richness of its coloring it is one of the
most beautiful insects of our region. Its back has the brilliance of a gem such as
no jeweler ever possessed. One would really take it to be made of gold, but gold of
a peculiar sort and much richer than ours, flashing as it does with red, green, and
purple glints. There is nothing to compare with this dazzling costume. It should be
added that if the insect is taken between the fingers it emits, as a means of defense,
a strong odor reminding one of a chemist’s disagreeable drugs.
</p>
<p>“The calosoma does not share the scarab’s peaceful habits: it is an ardent hunter
and leads a life of carnage. Its prey is the caterpillar, the bigger the better, whether
smooth-skinned or hairy. If you happen to find a calosoma, put it into a good-sized
bottle and give it for dinner a lusty young caterpillar as large as your finger. You
will see with what ferocious satisfaction this drinker of blood will disembowel the
poor worm, despite all its writhing and squirming, and will feast on its green entrails.
</p>
<p>“The carabid, which is also a passionate lover of game, has the calosoma’s activity
and brilliance, but is of smaller size. Some are bronze in color, others golden, still
others of a copper tint, or black edged with a superb violet. All explore with keen
scrutiny <span class="pageNum" id="pb238">[<a href="#pb238">238</a>]</span>the thick tufts of grass, and give chase to small prey such as larvæ, caterpillars,
and worms. The most common example of this class wears a golden green coat and is
a frequenter of gardens, where it makes war on all kinds of vermin. It is the little
guardian of our beds of peas and beans, and of our flower borders. In honor of its
services to the garden we call it the gardener.
</p>
<p>“The calosoma and the carabid do not fly; they are made for running, as is evident
from their long legs, their agile movements, and their lithe form. They chase the
game in hot pursuit, or else lie in wait for it behind a leaf, but never pursue it
on the wing. On the other hand, the scarab, the common June-bug, and a host of other
insects fly very well.”
</p>
<p>“But why don’t they all fly?” asked Emile.
</p>
<p>“I will tell you,” replied his uncle. “Look carefully at the June-bug a moment. It
has two kinds of wings: on the outside two large and substantial scales of horn, and
beneath these two fine membranous wings, expanded during flight, but carefully folded
together and concealed when not in use. The outside scales are called elytra, or sheaths.
They serve as a case for enclosing and protecting the delicate membranous wings, which
alone are fitted for flying. The carabid and the calosoma have sheaths of splendid
brilliance, it is true, but beneath these sheaths there are no membranous wings to
spread themselves in flight and fold up again in repose. Hence these two insects are
unable to fly.
</p>
<p>“The dytiscus and the hydrophile, whose names <span class="pageNum" id="pb239">[<a href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>signify ‘diver’ and ‘water-lover’ respectively, both frequent the waters of deep ponds,
of ditches, and of pools. With their legs flattened out like oars, their very smooth
bodies, arched above and keel-shaped below, they are first-rate swimmers and divers.
It is a feast for the eye to follow the graceful agility of their oars when they row
calmly on the surface or plunge beneath it.
</p>
<p>“At the least alarm they dart quickly to the bed of the pond and take refuge amid
the water plants. On the instant of diving their belly is seen to flash like a plate
of polished silver. The reason of this borrowed sheen is found in a thin layer of
air that they carry with them adherent to the belly. With this supply they will have
air to breathe until, all danger past, they ascend again to the surface.
</p>
<p>“In the matter of costume these two master-swimmers are of modest appearance. Both
are of a very somber olive green, but in addition the dytiscus wears faded gold lace
on its sheaths. If the pond dries up or ceases to please them, they can quickly betake
themselves to another—not on foot, for their flattened legs, excellent as oars, are
worthless in walking, but by flight, with the help of their membranous wings, ordinarily
hidden under the sheaths, where the water cannot reach them.
</p>
<p>“In old oak trees the larva of the capricorn-beetle, another ravager of forests, leads
much the same kind of life as does the grub of the stag-beetle. Large in size, all
black with gleams of chestnut, this insect is remarkable for its jointed horns, which
are longer <span class="pageNum" id="pb240">[<a href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>than its body. What can it do with these cumbersome ornaments? Does it wear them on
its forehead to intimidate the foe? I would not venture to dispute the matter, but
what I do know very well is that with its extravagantly long horns it frightens the
inexperienced young pupil so that he dares not touch it, and he calls it the devil.
All the same, the capricorn-beetle does not deserve the evil reputation it has got
from the timid. It is perfectly harmless.
</p>
<p>“Insects’ horns are called antennæ. All have them, some longer and some shorter, now
of one shape, now of another. In some instances they are flexible filaments, jointed
chaplets; in others, short stems ending in either a cluster of little buds or a bunch
of leaves pressed one against the other. See for example the burly and magnificent
insect that browses the foliage of our pine-trees on warm summer days. It is called
the pine-beetle. On a chestnut background it wears a sprinkling of white spots. The
antennæ carry at the end a set of little plates or scales which open and shut like
the leaves of a book.
</p>
<p>“It is in place here to mention the common June-bug, furnished like the pine-beetle
with antennæ bearing leaf-clusters at the end. I propose to tell you its story in
detail; for, if this little creature is the joy of young people of your age, it is
also the terror of the farmer.
</p>
<p>“But first one word more to conclude our short story of sheath-winged insects. Their
number is immense. Nearly all have membranous wings under <span class="pageNum" id="pb241">[<a href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>the protecting case formed by the sheaths; and these can fly. Others, relatively few,
are unprovided with membranous wings, and hence are unfitted for flight. This entire
group bears the general name of <i>coleoptera</i>, meaning sheath-winged. A coleopter is any insect furnished with sheaths, whether
it flies or not.”

<h2 class="main">THE JUNE-BUG</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“It is a discovery of no small importance in your eyes, my young friends, when you
find the first June-bug of the season on the young foliage. In the evening you get
together in a corner and talk about it, you make plans for the morrow, and all your
conversation is about the June-bug that has just arrived. You arrange to get up early
the next day and shake the trees in order to bring down the sleeping insects; you
get ready a box, pierced with holes, to receive the captives, and put in a handful
of fresh leaves for them to feed on.
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p242width"><img src="images/p242.png" alt="June-bug" width="138" height="243"><p class="figureHead">June-bug</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“At the first streak of dawn you are up; you visit the willows, the poplars, the hawthorn
hedges wet with dew. It is a fruitful hunt: the June-bugs, benumbed by the chill of
night, fall like hail when you shake the branches. Soon you have a half a score of
them, then a dozen, then twenty. It is enough. You go back to the house with your
prisoners fluttering and struggling in the foot of an old stocking, in your <span class="pageNum" id="pb243">[<a href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>handkerchief, or in your cap. You bring a supply of green leaves.
</p>
<p>“And now for your experiments! You tie a long string to the leg of one of the beetles
and put the insect in the sun. It inflates and deflates its belly, raises its wing-sheaths,
and expands its wings. There it goes, into the air. Your experiment has succeeded.
These delights of the June-bug season, my children—enjoy them as long as you can.
Other pleasures pale beside them. In view of the amusement it affords you I gladly
welcome the June-bug. But turn now to a less pleasing aspect of the matter.
</p>
<p>“Like every other insect, the June-bug is at first a grub. In that form it lives three
years in the ground, whereas in its final state, when it is found on trees and bushes,
it lives but two or three weeks. This grub or larva is commonly called the white grub,
also the fish-worm, and sometimes the ground-hog. Look at it carefully for a moment
and tell me what you see.”
</p>
<p>“I see,” answered Louis, “a fat, big-bellied worm, slow in its movements, and fond
of lying curled up on its side. It is of a whitish color with a yellowish head.”
</p>
<p>“Yes, and what else?”
</p>
<p>“It has six legs, not made for running on the surface of the ground, but for crawling
underneath; and it has strong jaws for biting the roots of plants. Its head is capped
with horn to help it in boring through the soil.”
</p>
<p>“Very good,” was Uncle Paul’s approving comment; <span class="pageNum" id="pb244">[<a href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>“and you see how the stomach is distended with food, which shows in a darker tint
through the white skin of the paunch. So gorged is the worm, in fact, that it cannot
stand on its legs, but lies lazily on its side.
</p>
<p>“For three years this fat grub lives under ground, always under ground, tunneling
like a mole in all directions, and living on roots. Then it makes for itself a little
chamber out of earth, very smooth inside, and shuts itself up there; after which it
proceeds to transform itself into a nymph, and then into a June-bug. Everything serves
it for food: the roots of grass and of trees, of cereals and of fodder, of vegetables
and of flowers. In winter it buries itself deep in the ground and becomes torpid;
at the approach of spring it returns to the upper layers of the soil, installs itself
among the roots, and goes from plant to plant, leaving devastation in its path. You
have, let us suppose, a fine bed of lettuce in your garden. From no apparent cause,
some morning, you find it all withered. You pull up one of the plants, and it proves
to have no root; the white grub has cut it away. Or you have a nursery of young fruit
trees for your orchard. The terrible worm passes that way, and your nursery is good
for nothing but fire-wood. Or you have sown several acres with wheat or rape, you
have made a considerable outlay for fertilizer and labor; but there is promise of
a handsome harvest with large profit to you. The larva of the June-bug works its way
up from the depths, and then good-bye to your harvest; the stalks <span class="pageNum" id="pb245">[<a href="#pb245">245</a>]</span>dry up as they stand, having no roots left to sustain them. When this formidable worm
invades a country, famine would surely follow were it not that traffic facilities
make possible the speedy importation of provisions from other lands. We live in a
progressive age and, thanks to the means of transport and to the briskness of trade,
people do not die of hunger in a province whose fields have been devastated by the
white grub. They do not die of hunger, but what woe follows in the wake of the devouring
larva! Year in and year out, it destroys millions of francs’ worth of crops in France
alone.
</p>
<p>“The multitude of these little insects is truly terrifying. When they invade a field,
the earth, undermined in all directions, loses its firmness and yields under the pressure
of the foot. One year, in the department of the Sarthe, the ravages became so serious
that it was necessary to undertake a systematic destruction of the pest. The June-bug
was hunted on a large scale, and sixty thousand decaliters were gathered in, each
decaliter containing about five thousand insects. Thus the total number taken amounted
to three hundred millions. To give you some idea of the immensity of this number I
will add that if you should try to count those three hundred million insects, one
by one, it would take you more than twenty years, working ten hours a day.
</p>
<p>“In the department of the Lower Seine there was at one time found to be an average
of twenty-three larvæ of the June-bug to the square meter, or two hundred and thirty
thousand devourers to each hectare. <span class="pageNum" id="pb246">[<a href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>A hectare will raise a crop of one hundred thousand beets. Thus each beet was gnawed
by at least two worms. Allowing eighty thousand rape-stalks to the hectare, we find
each stalk feeding three worms, or very nearly. It is clear that under these desperate
conditions no rape-seed oil or beet-root sugar can be produced. Every plant perishes.
In the single year 1866 the Lower Seine lost from this cause about twenty-five million
francs.
</p>
<p>“In 1868, in different parts of France, notably in Normandy, the multiplication of
June-bugs was so great as to spread alarm throughout the rural districts. Trees were
completely stripped of their foliage, and in the evening, when the insects fly abroad,
such clouds of them encumbered the atmosphere as to make it difficult to walk about.
Almost everywhere there were June-bug hunts organized, and those who gathered the
insects received from the public treasury from four to six francs per hundred liters.
In one place alone, Fontaine-Mallet, near Havre, there were gathered four thousand
and fifty-nine kilograms of the insects in four days. The school-master sent his pupils
out after June-bugs, and four hundred and forty kilograms was the result of one day’s
collecting. All these insects were carted to Havre by the wagon-load and drowned in
the sea. In certain communes they were brought to the town hall in such quantities
that there was no way of disposing of them. The air reeked with the stench they made.
</p>
<p>“It is said that in 1668 the June-bugs destroyed all <span class="pageNum" id="pb247">[<a href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>the vegetation in one county of Ireland, so that the country presented the dead appearance
of winter. The sound made by the insects’ mandibles in browsing the foliage of the
trees was like that of a carpenter’s saw, and the hum of wings resembled the distant
beating of drums. Enveloped in clouds of insects and blinded by the living hail, the
inhabitants could hardly see to go about. The famine was horrible: the poor Irish
people were even obliged to eat the June-bugs to keep from starving.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, how awful that must have been!” exclaimed the group of listeners.
</p>
<p>“Yes, awful, indeed,” assented Uncle Paul, “and I have a few more instances to relate,
less lamentable than the Irish famine, it is true, but still of a nature to show us
how prodigious were the legions of June-bugs in certain years. In 1832, in the neighborhood
of Gisors, a stage-coach became enveloped at nightfall in a cloud of these insects.
Blinded and terrified, the horses obstinately refused to go on. Finally there was
nothing to do but turn about and go back, so completely did the humming swarm bar
the way. Forty years ago the June-bugs descended upon Mâcon after ravaging the vineyards
in its vicinity. They were scooped up in the streets by the shovelful, and to make
one’s way through the cloud of beetles one had to clear a passage by the energetic
brandishing of a stick.
</p>
<p>“Since the June-bug is so redoubtable a scourge to agriculture, since it is a foe
with which one must reckon most seriously, how, you will ask, is it to be <span class="pageNum" id="pb248">[<a href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>got rid of? There is one way, and only one: collecting and destroying both grubs and
beetles. We can count to a certain extent on the help of moles, hedge-hogs, ravens,
crows, and magpies, all of which hunt the larvæ, especially in newly ploughed fields;
and we can also count on the aid of a host of birds such as shrikes, sparrows, and
others, which devour the beetles; but the number of the enemy is so great that this
destruction by natural means does not always suffice. We must then lend an energetic
hand ourselves. Which of the two is to enjoy the fruits of the earth, man or June-bug?
Man, if he will but bestir himself and wage unceasing war on both the insect and its
larva.
</p>
<p>“The white grub, as I told you, bores into the earth more or less deeply according
to the season. In winter it goes down half a meter, a depth at which it is protected
from the frost. Upon the return of milder weather it comes up again, to be within
reach of the roots; and from the first of April it can be found by digging down twenty
centimeters. A favorable time, therefore, is chosen for turning up the earth and bringing
the larvæ to the surface, whereupon women and children, following after the plough,
gather up the white grubs in the furrows. A single hectare has been known to yield
in this way from two hundred to three hundred kilograms of worms. The vermin are pressed
down into the earth with lime, the whole making an excellent manure, and the enemy
of harvests thus serves to accelerate their growth.”

<h2 class="main">CATERPILLARS AND BUTTERFLIES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Of all insects butterflies are the most graceful, the most worthy of childhood’s
eager desire. Oh, how beautiful they are! Poised on a flower, they seem to form a
part of it and to animate it with the gentle beating of their wings. You cautiously
draw near, you crouch down and make a quick clutch with the hand, but the beautiful
creature is no longer there. It is waiting for you on another flower, quite unconcerned
at your designs on its freedom. Let us leave it, then, to flit from one cluster of
lilacs to another, and occupy ourselves a while with an account of its structure and
habits.
</p>
<p>“All butterflies have four wings suitable for flying, two upper and larger ones, and
two lower ones half hidden under the others. Here we find no horny sheaths such as
are worn by the scarab and the June-bug, no protecting case under which the membranous
wings are folded to guard against laceration. The scarab is a clod-hopper, well acquainted
with the harsh irregularities of the ground. He pursues his plodding course on foot,
and it is only rarely that he spreads his wings in flight. The butterfly is a delicate
creature of the air, very seldom using its legs for walking, but finding them of service
when it <span class="pageNum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>alights upon a flower. It has, therefore, four broad wings, wide-spread and always
ready for flight.
</p>
<p>“And what wings! Words are lacking to describe them fitly. Some are white as if coated
with flour, others sky-blue, and still others sulphur-yellow. Again you find them
of a flame-like red or dark crimson. Some have round spots like eyes, which look at
you with their large pupils encircled by azure, mother-of-pearl, or gold; and you
will see others speckled with black, adorned with silver lace, or fringed with carmine.
If you touch them they leave on your fingers a brilliant powder beside which the filings
of the precious metals would look dull.
</p>
<div class="figure p250width"><img src="images/p250.png" alt="Butterfly" width="313" height="210"><p class="figureHead">Butterfly</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“This dust might be called the butterfly’s plumage. It consists of scales of extreme
delicacy, placed regularly side by side like the tiles on a roof, and attached by
one end to the membrane of the wing just as a bird’s feathers have their quills implanted
in its skin. Grasped roughly between the fingers, the wing parts with its delicate
covering; it loses its ornamental <span class="pageNum" id="pb251">[<a href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>scales and shows naked to the view. It is then a fine, translucent membrane traversed
by a network of tiny ribs, or nervures, as they are called, which hold it expanded
and give it firmness.
</p>
<p>“At rest, butterflies do not all carry their wings in the same manner. Those that
fly by day and go from flower to flower in full sunlight, hold their wings erect on
the back and folded against each other. These butterflies are also recognized by their
brilliant coloring, their lightness on the wing, their grace of form. Those,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2362src" href="#xd31e2362">1</a> on the other hand, that fly either by night or at evening twilight bear their wings,
in repose, either outspread or else lightly folded in a sort of roof-shape. They are
of bulkier form and heavier than the first-mentioned, and sombre hues predominate
in their costume.
</p>
<p>“Whether friends of light or fond of darkness, whether courting the sunshine or lovers
of the night, butterflies are invariably very abstemious, finding all the nourishment
they require in the tiny drop of honey exuding at the bottom of a flower. Many flowers
have long and narrow mouths; no insect muzzle is slender enough to reach into flasks
like these and lap up the syrup, and therefore butterflies must have a special instrument
adapted to the purpose.
</p>
<p>“<span class="corr" id="xd31e2369" title="Source: Thi">This</span> instrument is the proboscis, as fine as a hair and long enough to reach to the exquisite
drop, however deeply it may be hidden. When not in use, this <span class="pageNum" id="pb252">[<a href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>proboscis is kept tightly coiled at the entrance to the insect’s mouth. When it finds
a flower to its taste, it uncoils this spiral and extends the proboscis in a long
thread which plunges into the narrow-necked bottle and proceeds to suck up the coveted
drop. If we wished to drink from a flask of similar shape, we should use a straw or
reed. Its proboscis is the butterfly’s straw with which it takes its refreshment from
the flowers.
</p>
<p>“As with other insects, the butterfly is at first a larva or worm, very different,
you understand, from what the creature will afterward become. The larvæ of butterflies
are nothing in the world but caterpillars.”
</p>
<p>“Oh, how disgusting!” cried Emile, making a wry face.
</p>
<p>“But nevertheless so it is,” proceeded his uncle. “Caterpillars, repugnant creatures
to us, change into those magnificent butterflies that we are never tired of admiring.
What was ugly becomes beautiful, what was frightful finds itself the proud possessor
of grace and charm.
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p252width"><img src="images/p252.png" alt="Caterpillar" width="181" height="95"><p class="figureHead">Caterpillar</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“There are some caterpillars that have the skin quite naked and mottled with various
colors in a manner not unpleasing to the eye. To touch these worms, even to handle
them, inspires little or no <span class="pageNum" id="pb253">[<a href="#pb253">253</a>]</span>fear, so harmless do they look. But there are others, of a larger size, which carry
on the back, toward the rear, a menacing horn, a sort of hook, of which it seems prudent
to beware. This apprehension, however, is groundless: the horn is inoffensive, being
not a weapon but a mere ornament. Caterpillars thus equipped become large butterflies
flying in the late evening twilight.
</p>
<p>“Still others have an even more repulsive look, bristling as they do with clusters
of prickles and with tufts of long hair. From these ugly creatures, whose very touch
would be so disagreeable to us and would make us utter cries of fear, come some of
the most beautiful butterflies of our part of the world. Such is the caterpillar that
browses the leaves of the nettle and becomes the Vanessa Io or peacock-butterfly.
It is black with white spots, and wears a rough armor of toothed prickles. The butterfly,
the Vanessa, has wings of a bright brick-red adorned with a large eye of mingled black,
violet, and blue. Who would ever imagine, unless he had seen the transformation or
heard about it, that so ravishing a creature has such an origin?
</p>
<p>“But for all their hairs and prickles caterpillars need cause us no alarm. Nothing
about them justifies the fear they too often inspire. No caterpillar is poisonous,
no caterpillar seriously injures the hands that touch it. Yet it is well not to repose
full confidence in hairy caterpillars: sometimes the hairs become detached and cling
to the fingers, causing rather lively itching sensations. But a little scratching
<span class="pageNum" id="pb254">[<a href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>ordinarily ends the trouble. Accordingly any one who should hereafter be afraid of
caterpillars would not deserve the privilege of chasing butterflies.
</p>
<p>“Every larva is a gluttonous eater, because it must grow big and accumulate the wherewithal
for its subsequent changes of form. Nor are caterpillars lacking in response to this
serious duty. The future butterfly’s welfare is at stake. Made solely for eating,
the larvæ gnaw and browse unceasingly. Each one has its own particular kind of sustenance,
its chosen plant, and nothing else meets the requirements. The larva of the Vanessa
selects the nettle and turns with aversion from all substitutes; that of the Pieris,
a white butterfly with black spots, will have only the cabbage; that of the Machaon,
a butterfly with large wings that end in a sort of tail, feasts on fennel; and so
of others.
</p>
<p>“After attaining the full size assigned to them by nature, caterpillars, like other
larvæ, prepare for their transformation. Some shut themselves up in a cocoon made
from a silken thread that they spin from their mouth, while others content themselves
with binding together, by means of the small supply of thread at their disposal, particles
of earth, bits of wood, and hairs plucked from their own body. Thus is obtained, at
small expense, a sufficiently substantial temporary abode. Finally, still others,
especially among the butterflies that fly in the daytime, merely seek a retreat on
the side of some wall or against a tree-trunk, and there suspend themselves in a girdle
of silk.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb255">[<a href="#pb255">255</a>]</span></p>
<p>“These precautions taken, the caterpillar strips off its skin and becomes a nymph,
but very different from that which the stag-beetle showed us. The coleopter, in its
nymph stage, was already recognizable, with its branching mandibles, its legs folded
on its stomach, and its wings enclosed in their sheaths. The butterfly, on the contrary,
is not at all discernible under the casing of the nymph. This nymph, with skin as
tough as parchment, is an object little indicative of its true nature and much more
suggestive of the kernel of some strange fruit than of any animal form. Because of
its shape, so different from that shown to us by ordinary nymphs, it has received
a special name, that of <i>chrysalis</i>.

<p>“This word means golden sheath. Sometimes, notably in the case of the Vanessa, the
chrysalis is adorned with gilding; but in the great majority of instances the suggestive
name is not deserved, a uniform chestnut hue, darker or lighter, being the usual color
of the chrysalis. Ripened by long repose, this species of animal shell splits down
the back and releases the perfect insect, complete in all its attributes. The butterfly
passes a few festive days amid the flowers, and before dying lays eggs whence will
spring caterpillars to continue the race.”

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XLIX</h2>
<h2 class="main">ANTS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Ants live in communities, each containing many members, in underground abodes, where
the young are reared. These communities are composed of three kinds of insects: males
and females, recognizable by their large transparent wings, four to each ant; and
the neuters, or workers, which have no wings. These last, the workers, build the house,
take care of the community, rear the larvæ and bring them their food, distributing
it to each one. The others do not work. To add to the population by furnishing an
abundant supply of eggs is all that they are expected to do.
</p>
<p>“As soon as the rays of the morning sun strike the ant-hill, the workers standing
watch at the entrance hasten within, nudge their comrades with their antennæ to wake
them up, run from one to another, urge them on, hustle them into activity, and put
all the subterranean galleries into lively commotion. First of all, attention must
be given to the larvæ, feeble transparent worms, without feet and unable to feed themselves
and to grow unless they receive assiduous care from their nurses.
</p>
<p>“Accordingly, aroused by the tumult caused by the workers rushing in from outside,
the ants proceed to <span class="pageNum" id="pb257">[<a href="#pb257">257</a>]</span>busy themselves with the larvæ and also with the nymphs, carrying them with all possible
expedition into the open air and placing them where they will best be exposed for
some time to the benign influence of the sun’s heat. After this sun-bath they are
returned to the darkness and stowed away in chambers expressly prepared for them.
And now is the time for feeding the nurslings.
</p>
<p>“Just as little birds receive the beakful of food, so do the larvæ take their nourishment.
When they are hungry they raise themselves a little and seek the mouth of some one
of the workers engaged in ministering to them. The nursing ant opens its mandibles
and lets a tiny drop of sweetened liquid be taken from its mouth. Thus, one suck at
a time, the nutritive juice is distributed until the entire brood is fed.
</p>
<p>“But carrying the larvæ into the sun and feeding them will not suffice: they must
also be kept in a state of extreme cleanliness. The workers bestow upon their charges
the same tender care that the mother cat exercises toward her kittens. Over and over
again they lick the nursling’s body to give it perfect whiteness, and they tug cautiously
at the wrinkled skin when the transformation draws near.
</p>
<p>“Before casting this skin the larva spins itself a cocoon of silk, elongated and cylindrical
in shape, pale yellow in color, very smooth, and compact in texture. Under cover of
this protecting sac, the worm becomes a nymph. In this form the ant assumes <span class="pageNum" id="pb258">[<a href="#pb258">258</a>]</span>its final shape, lacking only strength and a little firmness. All its members are
distinct, but enveloped in a fine membrane which it must strip off to become a perfect
insect.
</p>
<p>“If you disturb an ant-hill you will see the workers hastening to carry away and put
in a safe place certain cylindrical bodies having somewhat the appearance of grains
of wheat and very inappropriately called ant-eggs. They are not the eggs of the insect,
which are in reality much smaller; they are cocoons with their contents, larvæ at
first, nymphs later.
</p>
<p>“When the time comes for leaving its cocoon, the enclosed ant is unable of itself
to gain its freedom by piercing with its mandibles the silken envelope; it possesses
nothing resembling the solvent liquid which the silk-worm holds in reserve in its
stomach; nor has it at the forward end of its prison-cell a door for exit <span class="corr" id="xd31e2421" title="Source: analagous">analogous</span> to the curious paling provided for the great peacock-butterfly. It would perish in
its silk sack if the working ants did not bestir themselves for its deliverance.
</p>
<p>“Three or four of these mount the cocoon and strive to open it at the end corresponding
to the prisoner’s head. They begin by weakening the texture of the sac by tearing
away a few threads of silk at the point where the opening is to be made; then, nipping
and twisting the tissue so difficult to break through, they at last succeed in puncturing
it with a number of holes near one another, whereupon the mandibles are applied at
one of these holes just as <span class="pageNum" id="pb259">[<a href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>one would apply a pair of scissors, and a narrow strip is cut away. At this hard labor
the ants work in relays, toiling and resting by turn. One holds the narrow strip that
has been cut, while a second enlarges the opening, and a third gently extricates the
young ant from its natal sac.
</p>
<p>“At last the insect comes forth, but unable to walk or even to stand on its legs,
for it is still enswathed in a final membrane which it cannot strip off unaided. The
workers do not forsake it in this new predicament; they free it from the satin envelope
enwrapping all its members; with delicate care they extricate the antennæ from their
sheaths; they disengage the feet and set the body at liberty. Then the young ant is
in a condition to walk about and, above all, to take nourishment, which it greatly
needs after all this fatiguing exertion. Its liberators vie with one another in offering
the mouth and disgorging a little sweetened liquid. For some days longer the workers
keep a watchful eye on their new companions and follow them about, acquainting them
with the labyrinthine passages of their abode. Thus instructed, the young ants mingle
with the others and share their labors.
</p>
<p>“The nurses remaining at home to perform the household duties depend for their rations
on the workers that go out to collect supplies. These latter bring them little insects,
or pieces of those that they have dismembered on the spot when the entire prey is
too large for conveyance. Whatever they may be, these provisions are passed around
and are <span class="pageNum" id="pb260">[<a href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>speedily disposed of by the assembled company. If the working ants chance to find
ripe fruit or large pieces of game that cannot be divided into small parts, they adopt
another mode of procedure. Placed in possession of so great riches, they content themselves
with the juice alone, of which they imbibe copiously, then return home with stomachs
full of liquid food which they disgorge, drop by drop, as fast as their hungry comrades
present themselves.
</p>
<p>“The ant in need of nourishment strikes rapidly with its antennæ those of the ant
expected to render the desired assistance. Presently they are seen to approach each
other with open mouths and tongues out in readiness for the transfer of the nutritive
liquor from one to the other. During this operation the ant receiving the mouthful
of sustenance keeps up an uninterrupted caressing, with fore legs and antennæ, of
the ant ministering to its needs.
</p>
<p>“Who is not familiar with the lice that infest plants, assembled in dense groups that
contain each more members than one could easily count? There are black lice on the
beanstalks, green ones on the rosebushes, their stomachs carrying, behind, two little
tubes whence oozes from time to time a tiny drop of liquid. This liquid is the ant’s
main dependence for food. Let us follow an ant on its rounds among the plant-lice.
</p>
<p>“It goes hither and thither among the motionless herd, which is nowise disturbed by
its presence. Having found what it is after, the ant stations itself close to one
of the lice, which it proceeds to caress <span class="pageNum" id="pb261">[<a href="#pb261">261</a>]</span>with gentle taps of its antennæ on the little creature’s stomach, first on one side,
then on the other. The milch-louse allows itself to be seduced by these friendly overtures,
and a drop of liquid oozes out at the end of the tubes, the ant sucking it up at once.
A second louse is visited, and it too is solicited in the same caressing fashion.
It yields its drop of liquid and lets itself be milked, after which the ant passes
without delay to a third louse, which it coaxes in like manner. A fourth, probably
already drained, withstands the wheedling, whereupon the ant, perceiving that nothing
is to be hoped for there, proceeds to a fifth member of the herd and obtains what
it desires. A few of these mouthfuls are enough to satisfy an ant, and then it returns
to its home.
</p>
<p>“Certain ants are great stay-at-homes: for them it would be a painful infliction to
have to go out into the world. In order to spare themselves this necessity they raise
plant-lice and pasture them in enclosures very near the ant-hill so that the milking
may be done at leisure. These herded plant-lice are their precious possession, and
the community is more or less rich as it owns more or less of this property. It constitutes
the ants’ flocks and herds, their cows and goats. They build underground stables among
the grass-roots, and there keep the plant-lice which they obtain from a distance,
just as we gather our domestic animals under the roof of barn or fold.
</p>
<p>“Others display an even more curious ingenuity: they take possession of the lice living
on some branch or twig of a growing bush, and, jealously watchful <span class="pageNum" id="pb262">[<a href="#pb262">262</a>]</span>of their cattle, suffer no stranger to come and lay claim to the food-supply they
themselves are preparing to appropriate. With their mandibles they drive off all intruders;
they patrol the twig in vigilant defense and stand careful guard over their herds.
If the danger becomes too menacing, they hasten to carry away their livestock and
pasture it elsewhere, in a safe place.
</p>
<p>“Or, as still another device, they take little pellets of earth and build around the
twig a sort of pavilion, a structure with a very narrow opening, a sheep-fold, in
a word, with a few leaves growing inside it and furnishing sustenance to the enclosed
flock. In this quiet retreat the proprietors milk their ewes, safely sheltered from
rain and sun and, most important of all, from alien ants.
</p>
<div class="figure p262width"><img src="images/p262.png" alt="Texas Red Ant" width="275" height="106"><p class="figureHead">Texas Red Ant</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“We have in this region a rather large reddish ant known as the red ant or Amazon
ant, which cannot without help build its house, raise its larvæ, procure food, or
even eat food; but with its hooked mandibles it is admirably equipped for fighting
and pillage. Slaves are the object of its predatory raids, slaves to feed it, to go
out after provisions, to build the ant-hill, and to rear the young. A small black
<span class="pageNum" id="pb263">[<a href="#pb263">263</a>]</span>or drab ant is the object of its slave-hunting excursions.
</p>
<p>“In battalions of some thousands each the reds go forth in quest of a nest of drabs.
They break into the ant-hill notwithstanding its occupants’ resistance, and sack the
underground city. Presently they take their departure, each with his plunder between
his mandibles. They carry away, not the full-grown ants, since these could not be
trained to serve in the strange ant-hill and would speedily make their way back to
their former home, but the young ones, and the nymphs shut up in their cocoons.
</p>
<p>“Hatched in the domicile of the reds, the ants issuing from the stolen cocoons look
upon the natal ant-hill as their own and there <span class="corr" id="xd31e2457" title="Source: fulfil">fulfill</span> their customary duties with diligence. They go out after provender, undertake all
building operations, care for the larvæ of the Amazon ants, and feed their big and
stupid conquerors who, once in possession of enough slaves, never leave home again.”

<h2 class="main">THE ANT-LION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“On the margin of ponds and streams we may see, flying from one bulrush to another,
certain insects with large transparent wings and abdomen long and slender like a piece
of string. Some are of a bronze green color, others of a splendid indigo blue, while
still others, somewhat larger, are clothed in mingled black and yellow. They are called
libellulids or, more commonly, dragon-flies, and also devil’s darning-needles.
</p>
<div class="figure p264width"><img src="images/p264.png" alt="A Common Dragon-fly, Natural Size" width="331" height="219"><p class="figureHead">A Common Dragon-fly, Natural Size</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“Do you recognize the insect? Haven’t you ever run after it? Perched on a reed that
trembles in the current, it seems to be dozing and waiting for <span class="pageNum" id="pb265">[<a href="#pb265">265</a>]</span>you, its wings extended to the utmost. Your hand darts out to seize it. Good-bye,
darning-needle! It is ten paces away from you.”
</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed,” replied Louis, “every one has chased darning-needles, but I never knew
of any one’s catching them. And we don’t have to go so far as the brook or the mill-pond
to find them, either.”
</p>
<p>“No; not all of them are lovers of water. Some, in fact, avoid it and prefer sandy
places parched by the burning sun. A modest gray is their uniform, but they make up
for their lack of brilliancy by their curious mode of life while they are still in
the larva form. The picture that I show you here illustrates what these gray dragon-flies
look like at an earlier stage.
</p>
<p>“A singular creature and not exactly ingratiating in appearance. It would not be very
pleasant to encounter one in a lonely nook in the woods, little adapted though its
size is for attacking us. Look at its ferocious pointed nippers, opening and closing
like a pair of tweezers. Do they not betoken a thirst for blood? As a matter of fact,
the little creature lives by carnage exclusively; it is a hunter whose game is the
ant. Hence its name of ant-lion, or, as it might be put, the lion of the ants.
</p>
<div class="figure floatRight p265width"><img src="images/p265.png" alt="Ant-lion" width="235" height="89"><p class="figureHead">Ant-lion</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“Prey of that sort is incapable of serious resistance when once it has been seized
by those terrible <span class="pageNum" id="pb266">[<a href="#pb266">266</a>]</span>hooks; but it must first be seized, and there is the difficulty. The nimble ant scampers
off at the first approach of danger, and if it should chance to be hard pressed it
has only to run up a blade of grass and there be out of reach. The ant-lion, on its
part, heavy of paunch and short of leg, drags itself along very awkwardly; and, moreover,
if it ever undertakes to get over the ground—a rare occurrence—it always moves backward,
which is not what might be called a speedy gait and does not adapt itself to keeping
the object of one’s pursuit always in sight.
</p>
<p>“The chase being thus rendered impracticable, there remain the snare and the ambuscade.
The creature must capture by cunning what its sluggishness of movement makes it impossible
to get possession of otherwise. Let us see what form this cunning takes.
</p>
<p>“Hunt at the base of sun-exposed walls and rocks, and if you find there some little
nook with very fine and dry sandy soil, the ant-lion will seldom fail to be there
too. Its abode is easily recognized by the regular funnel-shaped hollow scooped in
the ground. The insect itself is invisible, being hidden under the sand at the bottom
of the excavation.
</p>
<p>“With the blade of a knife thrust obliquely into the ground lift up the bottom of
the funnel, and you will have the little creature, rather abashed at first by the
sudden destruction of its retreat, but soon recovered and striving to hide itself
in the soil by a backward movement. Make haste to take it and put it into a glass
under a layer of fine sand like that <span class="pageNum" id="pb267">[<a href="#pb267">267</a>]</span>beneath which you found it. There at your leisure you can watch it as it hollows out
its funnel, a pitfall for catching ants. You will see it put into practice the cunning
wiles of an ambushed hunter.
</p>
<p>“Let us for a moment stand as onlookers, mentally at least, while this work goes forward.
Placed on a bed of sand and restored from its former dismay, the ant-lion proceeds
to plunge its belly halfway into the soil; then, with this substitute for a plowshare,
and always moving backward, it draws a circular furrow. Returning to its starting-point
it draws a second furrow close to the first, then a third next to the second, and
so on with a great many more, each one of smaller circumference than the preceding,
so that they all together form a spiral which constantly approaches the center; and
as this living plow is driven deeper and deeper at each circuit, and throws outward
the soil that it turns up, the final result is a funnel of about two inches in diameter
and somewhat less in depth. There you have the ant-lion’s trap, the treacherous pitfall
in which the ants are caught.
</p>
<p>“Of course the huntsman employing such a device as this must himself keep well out
of sight. The ant-lion is too well versed in its art to violate this elementary principle.
It crouches down under the sand at the lowest point of the upturned funnel, with only
its nippers showing, and these are pressed close to the ground, but wide open and
ready to seize any luckless ant that may chance to tumble down the incline. Although
the horrible pincers are exposed, <span class="pageNum" id="pb268">[<a href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>they are not likely to excite suspicion, being easily mistakable from the edge of
the excavation for some stray bits of dead leaves.
</p>
<p>“These preparations completed, the insect lies in wait, perfectly motionless. Its
patience and its hunger are subjected to prolonged trial. Hours and even days pass
with no sign of game. Alas, how difficult it is in this world even for an ant-lion
to win its mouthful of bread!
</p>
<p>“But at last there comes an ant, on business bent that takes it into these parts.
Preoccupied with its own concerns, it takes no heed of the pitfall. Hardly has it
approached the edge of the chasm when the sand, which is extremely unstable, gives
way under the little creature’s feet. There is a land-slide, and with it down tumbles
the incautious ant. In mid-course it succeeds by desperate efforts in arresting its
descent. It struggles to regain the upper level; its tiny claws, trembling with fear,
catch as best they may at the roughness of the slope; but as soon as touched these
supports yield, and the down-rush begins anew with irresistible impetus.
</p>
<p>“One grain of sand, more firmly planted than the rest, offers some resistance. Perhaps
safety will be found in this point of support if it continues to withstand the strain.
It holds firm, surely enough. The ant climbs up a little, heedful of its steps for
fear of precipitating another slide. It has almost gained the edge of the excavation
and seems about to find its feet once more on firm ground. Will it indeed escape scot-free?
<span class="pageNum" id="pb269">[<a href="#pb269">269</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Oh, no. The hungry watcher at the bottom of the funnel will have something to say
on that subject. He intends to make a good dinner on the ant. If things had followed
their customary course and the imprudent victim, caught in the trap, had continued
to slide down until within reach of the nippers, these would have seized their prey
without further formality; but since the game seems about to escape, it is the huntsman’s
part to employ the manœuvres reserved for difficult cases.
</p>
<p>“The ant-lion’s head is flat and somewhat shovel-shaped. The insect plunges it into
the sand and then, with a sudden movement of the neck, throws the shovelful up into
the air so that it will come down again on the ant. Other shovelfuls follow in quick
succession, better and better directed, and fall back in a hail-storm on the now nearly
exhausted ant.
</p>
<p>“Against this shower of sand resistance is impossible when one stands on a treacherous
footing that gives way at each attempt to escape. The poor victim is swept away and
rolls to the bottom of the funnel. Instantly the nippers seize their prey, and all
is over. The huntsman goes to his dinner, not gnawing the fruit of his patient skill,
since it is too tough for that, but sucking the juice like the refined epicure he
is.
</p>
<p>“When there is nothing left of the ant but a dry husk, the ant-lion loads it on to
his head and with an upward toss throws it out of the funnel, in order not to defile
his place of ambush with a useless corpse which might arouse the distrust of passers-by.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270">270</a>]</span>Then a little careful mending restores the pitfall to its former mobility, and the
huntsman waits patiently for another ant to take a false step and slide down into
his lair.”

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER LI</h2>
<h2 class="main">VENOMOUS ANIMALS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Among venomous animals there are some whose poisoned weapon has no other purpose
than to serve as a means of defense. Such is the bee, the worker in honey of our hives;
such also is the burly, hairy bumblebee, which also gathers a store of honey, but
keeps it underground in rude little pots of wax. Let us not molest them at their task,
either intentionally or otherwise, and they will not molest us. If we irritate them,
they straightway draw on the aggressor and stab him with their venomous dagger. This
weapon they carry for defense, not for attack.
</p>
<p>“But there are other and more redoubtable creatures that use their venom for killing
quickly, and without any dangerous struggle on the victim’s part, the prey on which
they feed. Of course the offensive weapon is capable of becoming also a defensive
one in moments of peril: that which serves to kill the prey serves likewise to repel
the enemy. Among animals making this double use of their venomous weapon, first for
attack and then for defense, let us note the scorpion and the viper.
</p>
<p>“The scorpion is a hideous creature and of interest to us solely on account of its
sting. It has a flattened stomach, dragging on the ground, and no <span class="pageNum" id="pb272">[<a href="#pb272">272</a>]</span>distinct head. In reality it has a head, but so little differentiated from the rest
of its body as to give a truncated appearance to the whole. On each side are four
feeble legs, and in front a big pair of nippers like those of the crab. Behind is
a sort of jointed tail, the terminal joint of which, more swollen than the others,
serves as reservoir for the venom. It ends in a hook, very sharp and with a microscopic
perforation at the point, from which the venomous fluid escapes at the instant of
attack.
</p>
<p>“In this jointed tail with its terminal sting you behold the scorpion’s implement
of the chase, a terrible weapon which kills immediately, at one stroke, any small
game the animal may have seized. It is carried bent over on the back, ready to inflict
its deadly wound in front or behind with the suddenness of a released spring. The
two-jawed nippers, of which only one jaw moves, are harmless despite their menacing
appearance. They are a sort of tongs used by the animal to hold within reach and prevent
from escaping the prey it is about to sting.
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p272width"><img src="images/p272.png" alt="Scorpion Seen from Above" width="135" height="288"><p class="figureHead">Scorpion Seen from Above</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“The scorpion is carnivorous, feeding on all game adapted to its size, such as wood-lice,
insects, spiders. Endowed with but little agility, it leaves its lair by night and
under cover of the darkness hunts its sleeping prey. Let <span class="pageNum" id="pb273">[<a href="#pb273">273</a>]</span>us suppose it to chance upon a big spider. That is indeed a succulent morsel, but
its capture involves danger, for the spider on its side is armed with two venomous
fangs in its mouth. Being both thus equipped with deadly weapons, which of the two
will succumb? It will be the spider.
</p>
<p>“The scorpion seizes it with its two nippers and holds the victim far enough away
to avoid the risk of a bite. Then the coiled tail quickly straightens out over the
scorpion and proceeds to inflict a sting on the helpless captive. It is all over.
The stricken prey gives a momentary shudder in its death agony and then collapses,
lifeless. The huntsman can now feast on his victim at leisure and in perfect security.
</p>
<p>“We have in France, in the southern departments, two species of scorpions, of which
the smaller and more common is of a greenish black. Its customary haunt is under the
stones at the base of old walls, the favorite lurking-place of the wood-louse and
the spider; but it also very often finds its way into human habitations, where it
hides in dark corners. In rainy weather it snuggles under the linen laid away in cupboards,
and even creeps under the bedclothes. Not a pleasant experience is it to find this
baneful intruder, some fine morning, in the foot of one’s stocking. One shakes out
the frightful creature and treads it under foot. If it has stung you, the pain is
no joke, though not seriously dangerous.
</p>
<p>“The other species, much larger and far more to be dreaded, is found almost exclusively
in Languedoc <span class="pageNum" id="pb274">[<a href="#pb274">274</a>]</span>and Provence. It is straw-color in hue and inhabits sandy hillocks where the sun beats
down with the fiercest heat. There, under some large stone, it digs itself a den,
a spacious retreat, whence it issues only by night in quest of something to eat. It
is never known to intrude into houses, nor does it ever leave the warmth of its desert
solitudes. Unless you disturb it by lifting up the flat stone that roofs its abode,
you run no risk of encountering the sting; but woe to the reckless one who should
rashly venture to rummage in that retreat. The creature’s sting is sometimes deadly,
they say.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>“The viper makes its home, by preference, on some warm and stony hillside, where it
lurks under the stones and in the tangled underbrush. Its color is brown or reddish,
with a darker zigzag stripe on the back and a row of spots on each side. Its belly
is <span class="pageNum" id="pb275">[<a href="#pb275">275</a>]</span>of a gray slate-color, and its head, larger than the neck, is blunted as if cut off
in front.
</p>
<p>“It is an extremely timid creature and never attacks man except in self-defense. Its
movements are brusque, irregular, and heavy. Like all serpents it feeds on live prey,
especially insects and small field-rats. To capture these quickly and to deprive them
of the power to defend themselves, the viper first inflicts a venomous wound, as does
the scorpion.
</p>
<p>“All serpents dart out and in between their lips, with extreme velocity, a black,
thread-like member, forked at the end and of great flexibility. Many persons take
this to be the reptile’s sting, though in reality it is nothing but its tongue, a
tongue void of offense and used by its possessor to snap up insects and also to express,
in the snake’s peculiar manner, by quickly passing out and in between the lips, the
passions that agitate the creature. All serpents have this sort of tongue, but in
these regions it is only the viper that possesses the terrible weapon for inflicting
venomous wounds.
</p>
<p>“This consists, first, of two fangs, or long, sharp teeth, situated in the upper jaw.
These curved teeth are movable, starting up for attack, at the reptile’s will, or
lying down in a groove of the gum and remaining there as inoffensive as a stiletto
in its sheath. Thus the risk of a self-inflicted wound is avoided. These fangs are
each pierced from end to end with a narrow channel having at the tooth’s point a minute
opening through which the venom is discharged into the wound. Finally, at the base
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb276">[<a href="#pb276">276</a>]</span>each fang is a tiny sac filled with venomous liquid. As with the bee and the scorpion,
this liquid is harmless in appearance, free from odor, and without taste—little else
than water, one would say. When the viper attacks with its fangs, the venom-sac presses
a drop of its contents into the dental canal and the terrible liquid passes into the
wound. In short, the whole operation exactly corresponds to the similar procedure
I have described in speaking of the bee’s sting.
</p>
<p>“Let us suppose you are so imprudent as to disturb the reptile as it lies asleep in
the sun. Immediately the creature uncoils itself and, with jaws wide open, smites
your hand. It is all over in a twinkling. Then, with the same rapidity, the viper
recoils itself and settles back again, continuing to threaten you, with its head once
more the center of the spiral coil.
</p>
<p>“You do not wait for a second attack; you beat a hasty retreat; but, alas, the harm
is done. On your wounded hand you discover two tiny red spots, apparently of little
more significance than the sting of a bee. No cause for alarm, you say to yourself
if you are unacquainted with the effects of such a wound. But it is a false reassurance.
</p>
<p>“Presently the red spots are encircled with a zone of livid hue. With a dull sensation
of pain the hand becomes swollen, and gradually the swelling extends to the entire
arm. Before long there follow cold sweats and a feeling of nausea, breathing is rendered
difficult, vision is clouded, the intellect is torpid, <span class="pageNum" id="pb277">[<a href="#pb277">277</a>]</span>and unless timely aid is rendered death may be the sequel.
</p>
<p>“What is to be done in the face of such danger? One must press tightly or even bind
fast the finger, the hand, the arm, above the wound, in order to prevent the passage
of the venom into the blood. The wound must be made to bleed by the exercise of pressure
all around it; it must be energetically sucked to draw out the venomous liquid. I
have explained to you in speaking of the bee, and I now repeat it, that venom is not
a poison. It will not act, however powerful it be, unless it mixes with the blood.
Sucking it, therefore, is without danger if the lining of the mouth is intact.
</p>
<p>“It is plain that if, by energetic suction and by pressing until the blood flows,
we succeed in extracting all the venom from the wound, the latter will henceforth
be of no serious importance. For greater security, as soon as possible the wound should
be cauterized with a corrosive fluid, such as ammonia or nitric acid, or even with
a red-hot iron. Cauterization acts in such a manner as to destroy the venomous matter.
It is painful, I admit, but one must submit to that in order to escape something worse.
</p>
<p>“Cauterization falls within the physician’s province; but the preliminary precautions—ligature
to stop the spread of the venom, pressure to make the envenomed blood flow, and suction
to extract the venomous liquid—are matters for our personal attention; and all this
should be taken in hand immediately, <span class="pageNum" id="pb278">[<a href="#pb278">278</a>]</span>since the longer the delay the more serious the case becomes. When these precautions
are taken it is very seldom that the viper’s bite has fatal consequences.”

<h2 class="main">THE PHYLLOXERA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“In our talks on ants a few words were said concerning their milch-cows, plant-lice.
You haven’t forgotten those curious herds with udders in the form of two little tubes
that emit, from time to time, a sweetened liquid. The ant comes and milks these cows,
caressing them as it does so with its two antennæ. It fills itself with their milk,
making its stomach serve the purpose of a milk-pail, and then runs back, all bursting
with the delicious fluid, to disgorge it into the nurslings’ mouths.
</p>
<p>“These ant-cows are watched over with jealous vigilance; in case of need they are
pastured within enclosures, for fear of marauders. So far all is for the best: the
ants’ cattle afford us some passing amusement, and apparently they are open to no
serious reproach. But if we pursue our inquiries further the plant-lice will reveal
themselves to us under a far more serious aspect.
</p>
<p>“Let us speak first of rosebush lice. You wish to pluck a rose. Its perfume fills
the air, its form and color rejoice the eye. But just as you are about to break the
stem what do you find under your fingers? At the base of the flower and all over the
branch that bears it, the superb plant is contaminated <span class="pageNum" id="pb280">[<a href="#pb280">280</a>]</span>with a legion of green lice; a host of odious vermin has taken possession of it; the
magnificent has associated with it the disgusting. The eye is offended; the fingers
recoil before this species of animated bark which the slightest pressure turns into
a sticky mush. Let us pluck the rose nevertheless, and before shaking the lice from
it let us examine them a moment.
</p>
<p>“They are light green in color, big-bellied, and wingless. With a little attention
we distinguish the two minute posterior horns whence oozes the liquid on which the
ants regale themselves. They have, underneath, a sucker, straight and very slender,
a sort of bore which they push into the tender bark to extract from it the juices
on which they live. The sucker once implanted at any convenient point, the animalcule
seldom stirs from that spot. If it does decide to move a little, it is because its
well has run dry and it must bore another close beside it. A promenade of merely the
length of the branch is a liberty that only the most adventurous dare allow themselves.
As a rule, the plant-louse sticks to the spot where it was born, to the very end.”
</p>
<p>“But how can the stem of a rose get so completely covered with those little green
lice?” asked Emile.
</p>
<p>“That is easily explained,” answered his uncle. “Plant-lice multiply very rapidly,
since each one, without exception, from the first to the last, whatever their number,
becomes capable in a few days of procreating a family. The newly born settle down
beside their mothers, and are themselves soon surrounded <span class="pageNum" id="pb281">[<a href="#pb281">281</a>]</span>by their own progeny. These in turn, in a little while, have offspring of their own;
and so on, indefinitely, as long as the season lasts. Thus the stem, the branch, the
entire plant, become covered with lice so closely packed one against another that
in places the real bark is hidden by this bark of vermin.
</p>
<p>“Have you ever seen a garden-patch of broad beans overrun by black lice? There, better
than anywhere else, may be seen the rapidity of propagation. On that green expanse
appears at first a small black stain, announcing the beginning of the invasion. It
is a family of lice installed at the top of a beanstalk, the tenderest part of the
plant, where the insects’ suckers can work to best advantage. The gardener, as soon
as he is aware of what is going on, hastens to cut off this part of the stalk and
crush it under his heel. He hopes to exorcise the evil by destroying this nest of
vermin.
</p>
<p>“His hope is short-lived. A few days later, instead of one plant invaded there are
dozens. He lops off again; he turns up the remaining leaves and examines them one
by one; he crushes what vermin he finds, taking all pains to make the extermination
complete. Will he make an end of it this time? Not at all: the black hordes reappear
in greater numbers than ever; the invaded stalks can no longer be counted. A few lice
that escaped the slaughter were enough to infest the whole patch of beans. The foliage
hangs down, foul and withered; the young pods, riddled with punctures and corrugated
with <span class="pageNum" id="pb282">[<a href="#pb282">282</a>]</span>scars, shrivel up and can grow no larger. For this ill there is no remedy; the harvest
is ruined.
</p>
<p>“The gardener pulls it all up and throws it on the dung-hill. His care and vigilance
have been unable to arrest the invasion. In vain he crushed legions at a time under
his angry heel: in a few days the half-dozen survivors had propagated a larger colony
than ever. Man is hardly in a position to contend successfully against this lowly
vermin which braves extinction by virtue of its countless numbers.
</p>
<p>“As I told you, the plant-louse does not like to change its place. It plants its sucker
on the very spot where it has just been born, and thenceforth sticks to that spot,
filling its stomach with sap and surrounding itself with a family. This love of repose
explains to us very well how the twig of a rosebush or the top of a beanstalk undergoes
a progressive colonization; but it does not account for the distant propagation of
the species.
</p>
<p>“With its home-keeping habits the insect ought to be confined within narrow limits,
on a single leaf and not on all leaves, on one rosebush and not on the neighboring
rosebushes. But as a matter of fact it is disseminated everywhere. When one patch
of beans becomes infested, those in the neighborhood are equally unfortunate; when
one rosebush shows a colony of plant-lice, all those around it are similarly visited.
No vegetable growth can defend itself from the pest. How, then, is it that this obese
animalcule, which totters with fatigue after one step forward, succeeds in passing
from rosebush to rosebush, <span class="pageNum" id="pb283">[<a href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>from garden to garden? By what means is it able to spread in all directions without
limit?
</p>
<p>“Let us examine a number of rosebushes, and we shall have a prompt answer to our question.
In addition to the wingless plant-lice, big of belly and all grouped on the tender
twigs, we shall see others, green like the first ones, but more elegant in form, of
greater freedom of movement, and provided with four wings, very beautiful wings too,
diaphanous and gleaming with rainbow tints. These creatures are no lazy sap-bibbers
forever squatting over the well their sucker has bored. They are seen to come and
go, circulating briskly among the stationary herd, inspecting the foliage, passing
from branch to branch, and even taking flight for some distant goal. They are the
travelers of the family. Their function is to propagate the race in the surrounding
district, with the aid of their wings, and even at considerable distances when a puff
of wind carries them thus far.
</p>
<p>“Two classes, then, dissimilar though related, are to be noted among the green lice
of the rosebush and the black ones of the beanstalk, as also among countless others.
The members of one class have no wings; they pass their lives where they were born,
and multiply in serried legions. Those of the other class, which is relatively small,
are equipped with wings. Confined to no one spot, they fare forth as some passing
breeze or their own strength of wing may determine, and deposit in favorable localities
the germs that are to serve each as the beginning of <span class="pageNum" id="pb284">[<a href="#pb284">284</a>]</span>a community of wingless plant-lice. The first kind procreate on the spot with a fecundity
almost beyond belief; the second take leave of the stationary family and go out to
start new centers of population in various quarters. The first propagate without limit;
the second colonize.
</p>
<p>“To soil the stem of a rose with a coating of lice is not exactly a capital offense;
but to lay waste a field of beans, the hope of the farmer, is a far more serious matter.
Yet even that is as nothing when compared with other depredations committed by plant-lice.
There is a species of these insects that lives underground, subsisting on the roots
of the grape-vine. Oh, the hateful creature! Never has agriculture known anything
to equal the ravages it commits; no floods or droughts or inclement seasons have ever
wrought such woes. Its terrible sucker has, up to the present time, caused us losses
estimated at the fabulous sum of ten milliard francs. What a mouthful for a miserable
little louse hardly visible to the naked eye! And to think that the combined efforts
of nations cannot succeed in exterminating this pest! Alas, how feeble is mere force
when confronted with the exceedingly minute infinitely multiplied!
</p>
<p>“This destroyer of the vine is known as the phylloxera, a name strange to our tongue,
but losing nothing of its impressiveness in translation. ‘Phylloxera’ means ‘witherer
of leaves.’ The plant-louse thus denominated does indeed cause the foliage of the
vine to wither up—not acting on the leaves directly, <span class="pageNum" id="pb285">[<a href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>it is true, but attacking the roots. These, done to death by the insect’s sucker,
cease to draw from the soil the nourishment needed by the vine. The vine-stock wastes
away, and with it the leaves, which become yellow and withered.
</p>
<div class="figure p285width"><img src="images/p285.png" alt="Vine-pest (Phylloxera Vastatrix)" width="275" height="314"><p class="figureHead">Vine-pest (Phylloxera Vastatrix)</p>
<p class="first">a, Healthy vine rootlet; b, rootlet showing nodosites; c, rootlet in decay; d, female
pupa; e, winged female, or migrant. (Hair lines show natural sizes.)</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“It is not merely the foliage, then, that the phylloxera dries up; it withers and
kills the whole vine. Moreover, the name it bears was not invented expressly for it,
but was borne by another before the ravager of vineyards became known. The louse that
was first called phylloxera lived at the expense of the oak-tree and took up its station
on the leaves, sucking the sap from them. There you have the true witherer of leaves.
The vineyard louse has therefore <span class="pageNum" id="pb286">[<a href="#pb286">286</a>]</span>inherited an old appellation which fails to indicate fully the seriousness of the
creature’s depredations.
</p>
<p>“This last-named insect is a tiny yellowish louse, plump of body, but hardly discernible
to untrained eyes, its length being barely three quarters of a millimeter. It lives
in clusters on the minute ramifications of the roots wherever the bark is tender enough
to enable it to push in its sucker. Its ranks are so dense that the infested rootlets
wear a continuous coating of vermin which stains the fingers with yellow. It lays
its eggs in little heaps in the interstices that occur in the swarming colony; and
these eggs are oval in shape and sulphur-yellow at first, but turn brownish as the
moment for hatching approaches.
</p>
<p>“From these eggs there come, in a few days, new layers of eggs, which settle down
beside the earlier comers and add their own progeny to the already overgrown family.
Thus, as long as the season continues favorable, these myriad numbers of successive
generations are added to the existing myriads, until the thread-like rootlets become
completely hidden by the accumulated layers of eggs and the eggs themselves.
</p>
<p>“Riddled with punctures, the rootlets swell up at intervals and present the appearance
of a string of elongated seeds. Thus deformed, fatally injured in their delicate suckers,
the roots cease to imbibe the nutritive juices of the soil, the famished vine languishes
<span class="pageNum" id="pb287">[<a href="#pb287">287</a>]</span>for a time, putting forth only feeble shoots that are incapable of bearing fruit,
and at last the whole plant dries up and dies. To secure its own prosperity the louse
has killed its nurse.”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The yellow plant-louse found on the roots of the grape-vine,” resumed Uncle Paul,
“has no bent for traveling: wingless, sluggish, and big-bellied, it is ill adapted
to locomotion. Where once its sucker has implanted itself, there the creature is glad
to abide as long as the place is tenable. But when the rootlet dies and begins to
decay, then a new refectory must be sought out, with a better-furnished table. Accordingly
the louse has to move. A persistent explorer, it knows how, with patience and in course
of time, to make its way through cracks in the soil from one root to another, and
dares even to climb to the surface, where, proceeding in the open air, it emigrates
from the exhausted vine-stock to the neighboring one rich in sap; and there it pushes
down to the roots through some fissure in the ground.
</p>
<p>“To this slow-goer a single one of our steps would be a journey of excessive length.
Therefore, to propagate its kind far and wide, it must have other and quicker means
than the extremely deliberate method of locomotion just described. This other method
for planting colonies at a considerable distance has already been illustrated for
us by the <span class="pageNum" id="pb289">[<a href="#pb289">289</a>]</span>green louse of the rosebush. Like that species, the phylloxera has a special division
of winged travelers, and it is these that propagate the race throughout the grape-growing
district.
</p>
<p>“At the time of the greatest midsummer heat there make their appearance, amid the
throng of yellow lice covering the roots, certain individuals with longer bodies,
which soon change their skin and then bear on their sides two pairs of black stumps,
the sheaths of four future wings. These are the nymphs destined for emigration. These
nymphs leave their subterranean abode and climb up to the foot of the vine-stock,
or sometimes even out upon the surface of the ground. There another change of skin
takes place, whereupon we behold the winged insect, superior in form to its underground
relatives.
</p>
<p>“It measures a little more than a millimeter in length, not including the wings. These
latter, transparent and iridescent, extend far beyond the length of the body, and
the upper ones are wide, rounded, and slightly smoke-colored at the end, the lower
ones narrow and shorter. They are supported by strong sinews that denote great power
of flight. With its large, diaphanous wings, its broad head and big eyes, its belly
ending in a blunt point, and its yellowish color, the traveling insect bears some
resemblance to a very small cicada. Such, in brief, is the phylloxera commissioned
to propagate the race at a distance.
</p>
<p>“We have here no longer to do with the sluggish pot-bellied creature that needs all
its strength to <span class="pageNum" id="pb290">[<a href="#pb290">290</a>]</span>move from one root to the next adjoining; we behold an agile denizen of the air, capable
of covering with the swiftness of an arrow a distance of several leagues, especially
when aided by a favorable wind. During the warm season of July and August these winged
insects take flight and settle in swarms on the vineyards not yet ravaged. They alight
on the leaves, where their suckers perform their function in sober moderation.
</p>
<p>“To stuff themselves like gluttons, after the manner of their kindred that live on
the roots, is not their way. Hence their own depredations are of no importance. Unfortunately,
however, it is their mission to do us a most disastrous disservice by infesting, one
after another, the adjacent vineyards, peopling the still unaffected districts with
underground ravagers. All take part in this; all, without exception, set to work laying
eggs.
</p>
<p>“These eggs are few in number, it is true, each insect laying at most but half a score
amid the cotton-like down of the buds and young leaves. But the aggregate is none
the less enormous, since in this strange family we have thus far encountered none
but mothers. We have just seen that all the wingless phylloxeras on the roots lay
eggs, and now we find that all their winged kindred on the leaves do likewise.
</p>
<p>“This excessive fecundity would in the end exhaust the insect and result in its extinction
if there were no seasons of quietude for renewing the vitality of the race. Yellowish
in color like the eggs of <span class="pageNum" id="pb291">[<a href="#pb291">291</a>]</span>the underground phylloxera, those of the winged insect are of two kinds: one of a
larger size, the other only about half as large. The first produce females, the second
males. Here, at last, we have the two sexes, whose coöperation will assure indefinite
prosperity to the race. That is the normal order governing all animal life.
</p>
<p>“But what queer little creatures! Yellow, wingless, stubby, they look like the lice
on the roots, but even smaller. These phylloxeras of the third kind are dwarfs in
a family of dwarfs. They have no stomachs for digesting, no suckers for puncturing
the leaves and extracting their sap. Self-nourishment, however slight, is not at all
their affair. The laying of eggs that shall renew the vigor of the race, the placing
of them where they will be safe, and then a speedy death—that is the sole purpose
of their brief span of life.
</p>
<p>“For some days these dwarfs, male and female, wander over the vines and mate, one
with another; then, in the fissures of the wrinkled bark, the mothers lay each an
egg, a single egg, of enormous size in comparison with the smallness of the layer,
greenish in color and sprinkled with fine black spots. This egg takes the name of
‘winter egg,’ being destined to pass the cold season fastened by a little hook to
the vine’s bark. After this the layer of the egg shrivels up into a reddish point
and dies.”
</p>
<p>“But how do these eggs manage to get through the winter without freezing?” asked Louis.
“Hens’ <span class="pageNum" id="pb292">[<a href="#pb292">292</a>]</span>eggs or birds’ eggs would be good for nothing after being left out-doors from autumn
till spring.”
</p>
<p>“That is true,” assented Uncle Paul; “nevertheless these minute germs of future insect
life seldom fail to hatch when warm weather returns. From them come plant-lice like
those on the roots of the vine. Each new-born louse crawls down the natal vine, hunts
around on the ground until it finds a crack in the soil, and then makes its way through
this fissure to settle at last on a rootlet, into which it plunges its sucker. At
ease thenceforth beneath the surface of the ground and in the bosom of abundance,
it does not long remain alone. Close to its fixed position it deposits its little
heap of yellow eggs, whence there quickly issues a new generation. In like manner
each member of the family surrounds itself with a family of its own; and so on by
several successive repetitions of the process until, from having but a single occupant
at first, a root speedily becomes covered with a legion of destroyers. To this population
of recent origin we must not forget to add the older inhabitants that have passed
the winter under ground and have only waited for the return of the warm season to
resume their own laying of eggs on the roots of the vine.
</p>
<p>“Let us recapitulate these singular ways of the phylloxera. The species comprises
three forms of insects, each having its own peculiar structure, its manner of life,
its separate function. The customary animal unity is here a trinity: three different
insects are grouped in a single species.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb293">[<a href="#pb293">293</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The sedentary members are wingless and live on the roots. All lay eggs and are followed
by several generations likewise capable of laying eggs. Under the pricking of their
collective suckers, numberless in the aggregate, vineyards are ruined. There we have
the formidable foe, the ravager whose sucker, hardly visible to the naked eye, has
already cost us more than ten milliard francs.
</p>
<p>“The migrating members are furnished with large wings. They live on the leaves and
lay each a small number of eggs in the down of the buds. Like their sedentary kinsfolk,
they all lay eggs. Their peculiar office is to disseminate the race from one vineyard
to another.
</p>
<p>“The members endowed with sex come under the operation of the general law: they are
divided into male and female. Unprovided with wings, sucker, or stomach, they wander
over the vine without taking any nourishment. Each mother lays a single egg, the winter
egg, whence issues in the spring a sedentary phylloxera, which makes its way down
to the roots, establishes itself there, and becomes the head and center of a new colony.
</p>
<p>“How contend against this foe which, by reason of its numbers and its underground
abode, defies our attempts to exterminate it? Three principal methods are employed.
In the lowlands the vineyards are flooded and kept under a good depth of water throughout
the winter. This submersion causes the death of the phylloxera at the roots of the
plant. As a second method, through holes bored to the roots <span class="pageNum" id="pb294">[<a href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>the soil is injected with an asphyxiating fluid called sulphur of carbon, the fumes
of which instantly kill all insects that they reach. The difficulty is to do a thorough
job and leave no survivors. A third device is employed by those who import from America
certain wild vines much hardier than our cultivated ones, but producing inferior fruit.
These American plants resist the attacks of the phylloxera, and continue to flourish
where our vines would succumb. On these wild stocks, as soon as they are well rooted,
are grafted our native vines, and thus is obtained a grape-vine of two-fold quality,
resisting by the hardy nature of its root the phylloxera’s assaults, and bearing,
on its engrafted shoots, the incomparable fruit of our old vineyards.”

<h2 class="main">NOCTURNAL BIRDS OF PREY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The brown owl, the horned owl, the barn-owl and other species of this family, are
known under the name of nocturnal birds of prey. They are called birds of prey because
they live on the small animals that they catch, such as rats and mice, both those
that infest our houses and those that live in the fields. Owls are, among birds, what
cats are among quadrupeds,—the inveterate foes of all those small rodents of which
the mouse is our most familiar example.
</p>
<p>“The French language has recognized this analogy in its term <i>chat-huant</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2670src" href="#xd31e2670">1</a> (hooting cat) applied to a certain kind of owl. This bird is, in some sort, a cat
in its manner of living, a cat that flies and that utters a long-drawn cry like a
plaintive howl. It is nocturnal; in other words, it keeps itself hidden by day in
some obscure retreat, whence it comes forth only at nightfall, to hunt in the twilight
and under the rays of the moon.
</p>
<p>“Owls have eyes of remarkable size, round, and both in a frontal position instead
of being placed one on each side of the head. A broad rim of fine feathers encircles
each eye. The reason for their <span class="pageNum" id="pb296">[<a href="#pb296">296</a>]</span>great size is found in the bird’s nocturnal habits. Having to seek its food by a very
feeble light, it must, in order to see with any distinctness, have eyes that admit
as much light as possible; that is, eyes that open very wide.
</p>
<p>“But this wide-openness of the eyes, so advantageous by night, is a serious inconvenience
to the owl in the bright light of day. Dazzled, blinded, by the sun’s rays, the bird
of darkness keeps itself in hiding and dares not venture forth; but if forced to do
so, it observes the utmost circumspection, flying with cautious hesitation and by
short stages. The other birds, those accustomed to broad daylight, come and insult
it at will. Robin redbreast and the tomtit are the first to pay their compliments
in this manner, and are followed by the chaffinch, the jay, and many others.”

<p>“And doesn’t the owl do anything to get even with them?” asked Jules.
</p>
<p>“Very little,” replied his uncle. “Perched on a branch of some tree, the night bird
answers its aggressors by a grotesque balancing of its body, turning its large head
this way and that in a ridiculous <span class="pageNum" id="pb297">[<a href="#pb297">297</a>]</span>fashion, and rolling its eyes in bewildered alarm. Its menaces are vain: the smallest
and weakest birds are its boldest tormentors, pecking it and pulling its feathers
without its daring to defend itself.
</p>
<p>“Because of its wide-open eyes the nocturnal bird of prey needs a subdued light like
that of early dawn and of evening dusk. It is, therefore, at nightfall and at the
first signs of daybreak that these birds leave their retreats and seek their prey.
At these hours their hunt is a fruitful one, for they find the rats and mice, whether
those that lurk about our houses and barns or those that live in the field, either
fast asleep or on the point of going to sleep. Moonlight nights are the most favorable
for the nocturnal bird’s purposes. Such nights are nights of plenty, affording opportunity
for protracted hunting and many captures.
</p>
<p>“Let us follow the owl on its nocturnal expedition. The moment is propitious, the
air is calm, the moon shines. The bird leaves its sylvan retreat; it skims over the
open field, the meadow, the prairie; it inspects the furrows where the field-mouse
lurks, the long grass where it burrows, the ruins of deserted buildings where both
rats and mice scamper about.
</p>
<p>“Its flight is noiseless, its silent wing cleaving the air without the faintest sound.
It is careful not to give the alarm to its destined victims. This noiseless flight
it owes to the structure of its feathers, which are silky and finely divided. Nothing
betrays its sudden coming, and the prey is seized without even suspecting the enemy’s
presence. An extraordinarily <span class="pageNum" id="pb298">[<a href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>keen sense of hearing, on the other hand, advises the bird of all that is going on
in the neighborhood. Its ears, large and deep, perceive the mere rustle of a field-mouse
in the grass.
</p>
<p>“The prey is seized with two strong claws warmly clothed in feathers clear down to
the very nails. Each foot has four toes, of which three ordinarily point forward,
and one backward; but, by a privilege common to nocturnal birds of prey, one of the
anterior toes is movable and can point backward, so that the claw becomes divided
into two pairs of equally powerful grippers when the bird wishes to seize, as in a
vise, the branch whereon it perches or the victim struggling to escape.
</p>
<p>“A blow of the beak breaks the head of the captured rat. This beak is short and hooked,
and the two mandibles have great mobility, which enables them, in striking against
each other, to make a rapid clacking, a demonstration by which the bird expresses
anger or alarm.
</p>
<p>“The mandibles open wide in the act of swallowing, revealing a mouth of ample proportions
and a throat of excessive width. The prey, which has first been well kneaded by the
claws, disappears down this throat, bones and all. Nothing is left of the rat or the
mouse, not even the fur.
</p>
<p>“Digestion completed, there remains in the stomach a confused mass of skins turned
inside out and still wearing their fur, and bones stripped as clean as if they had
been scraped with a knife. The bird then proceeds to rid itself of this encumbrance
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb299">[<a href="#pb299">299</a>]</span>innutritious matter. Grotesque retchings indicate the labor of this deliverance. Something
makes its way upward through the extended throat, the beak opens, and the act is accomplished.
A rounded mass falls to the ground, composed of skins, bones, hair, scales—in fact,
everything that has defied digestion. All nocturnal birds of prey have this ignoble
manner of freeing the stomach: they vomit in globular form the residue of their prey
after the latter has been swallowed whole.”

<h2 class="main">THE SMALLER BIRDS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Almost all the smaller birds are helpful to us in protecting the fruits of the earth
from the ravages of insects. Their services deserve to be recorded in a long and detailed
history, but time for that is lacking and we must confine ourselves to brief mention
of a few of these valiant caterpillar-destroyers.
</p>
<p>“The titmouse, or tomtit, is a small bird full of life and showing a petulant humor.
Always in action, it flits from tree to tree, examines the branches with minute particularity,
perches on the swaying end of the frailest twig, where it clings persistently even
though hanging head downward, accommodating itself to the oscillations of its flexible
support without once relaxing its clutch or ceasing its scrutiny of the worm-infested
buds, which it tears open in order to get at the enclosed vermin and insect-eggs.
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p300width"><img src="images/p300.png" alt="Tufted Titmouse" width="207" height="190"><p class="figureHead">Tufted Titmouse</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“It is calculated that a tomtit rids us of three <span class="pageNum" id="pb301">[<a href="#pb301">301</a>]</span>hundred thousand of these eggs every year. It has to supply the needs of a family
seldom equalled in size; but the support of twenty young ones, or even more, is not
too heavy a burden for this active bird to bear. With this infant brood on its hands,
it must give constant and careful inspection to buds and to fissures in the bark,
in order to catch larvæ, spiders, caterpillars, little worms of all kinds, and thus
find food for twenty beaks incessantly agape with hunger at the bottom of the nest.
</p>
<p>“Let us suppose the mother bird to arrive with a caterpillar. The nest is immediately
all in a tumult: twenty beaks are stretched wide open, but only a single one receives
the morsel, while nineteen are kept waiting. The indefatigable mother flies off again,
and when the twentieth beak has at last been fed, the first has long since begun again
its importunate demands. What a multitude of worms such a brood must consume!
</p>
<p>“Whole families of birds devote themselves, as does the titmouse, to this patient
quest for insect eggs in the crevices of tree-trunks or concealed in rolled-up leaves,
for larvæ between the scales of buds and in worm-holes in wood, and for insects hidden
in cracks and crannies. In this kind of hunt the bird does not have to chase its game
and catch it by superior swiftness of flight; it must simply know how to find it in
its lair. To this end it needs a keen eye and a slender beak; wings play but a secondary
part.
</p>
<p>“But other species spend their energies in the free <span class="pageNum" id="pb302">[<a href="#pb302">302</a>]</span>open-air chase: they pursue their game on the wing, hunting for gnats, moths, mosquitoes,
and flying beetles. They must have a short beak, but one that opens wide and snaps
up unerringly insects on the wing, despite the uncertainties of <span class="corr" id="xd31e2723" title="Source: aerial">aërial</span> flight; a beak in which the victim is caught and held without any retardation of
the bird’s swift course; in short, a beak with a sticky lining which a tiny butterfly
cannot so much as graze with its wing and not become entangled. Above all, an untiring
and swift wing is necessary, one that does not flag in the pursuit of game desperately
putting forth its utmost efforts to escape, and one that is not baffled by the tortuous
course of a moth driven to bay. A beak inordinately cleft and wings of extraordinary
power—such, in a word, should be the equipment of the bird whose hunting ground is
the vast expanse of the open air.
</p>
<p>“These conditions are fulfilled in the highest degree in the swallow and the martin,
both of which hunt flying insects, pursuing them this way and that, back and forth,
ceaselessly and with a thousand subtle tricks. They catch them in their wide-open
and viscous gullet, and continue their course without a moment’s pause.
</p>
<p>“The bird that lives on grain and seeds, the granivorous bird, as it is called, has
a beak that is very wide at the base and adapted by its strength to the opening of
the hardest seeds. In this class are the chaffinch, the greenfinch, the linnet, the
goldfinch, and the swallow. The bird that lives on insects, or <span class="pageNum" id="pb303">[<a href="#pb303">303</a>]</span>the insectivorous bird, has a beak that is fine and slender, in delicacy proportioned
to the softness of its prey. To this number belong the nightingale, the warbler, the
fallow-finch, and the wagtail. Agriculture has no better defenders against the ravages
of worms than these little birds with slender beaks, voracious devourers as they are
of larvæ and insects.
</p>
<p>“But the granivorous birds have certain grave faults: some of them are addicted to
pilfering in the grain-fields and know how to get the wheat out of the ear, and some
even come boldly to the poultry-yard to share with its inmates the oats thrown to
them by the farmer’s wife. Others prefer the juicy flesh of fruit, and know sooner
than we when the cherries are ripe and the pears mellow. Such failings, however, are
amply atoned for by services rendered. The granivores pick up in the fields an infinite
number of seeds of all sorts which, if left to germinate, would infest our crops with
weeds.
</p>
<p>“To this rôle of weeder they add a second not less meritorious. Grain and seeds are,
it is true, their regular diet; but insects are to few of them so despicable as to
be refused when sufficiently plentiful and easy to catch. Indeed, we can go still
further in our commendation of these birds: in their early days when, feeble and featherless,
they receive their nourishment by the beakful from their parents, many of them are
fed on insects.
</p>
<p>“Let us take for example the house-sparrow. Here we have, it must be admitted, an
inveterate <span class="pageNum" id="pb304">[<a href="#pb304">304</a>]</span>devourer of grain. He robs our dove-cotes and poultry-yards, steals their food from
the pigeons and the hens, and anticipates the farmer in reaping the grain-crops near
his house. Many other misdeeds are to be reckoned against him. He plunders the cherry-trees,
commits petty larceny in the garden, plucks up sprouting seeds, and regales himself
on young lettuce and the first leaves of green peas. But as soon as the season of
insect-eggs opens, this shameless pilferer becomes one of our most valuable helpers.
Twenty times an hour, at least, the mother and the father take turns in bringing the
beakful of food to their little ones; and each time the bill of fare consists of a
caterpillar, or an insect large enough to be divided into quarters, or perhaps a fat
larva, or it may be a grasshopper, or some other kind of small game.
</p>
<p>“In one week the young brood consumes about three thousand insects, larvæ, caterpillars
and worms of all species. There have been counted in the immediate vicinity of a single
nest of sparrows the remains of seven hundred June-bugs, besides those of innumerable
smaller insects. That is the supply of food required for rearing only one brood. Let
us then, my children, wish well to all the little birds that deliver us from that
formidable ravager, the insect.”

<h2 class="main">BIRDS’ NESTS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“It is in the building of nests destined for the rearing of a family of young ones
that the bird shows in a remarkable way that wonderful faculty which enables the little
creature to accomplish, without previous training, results that would seem to require
the intervention of reasoned experience.
</p>
<p>“These adepts in bird-nest architecture have talents of the most varied sort. There
are diggers, who scoop out a hollow in the sand; miners, who excavate a little cell
to which a long and narrow passage gives access; carpenters, who bore into the trunk
of a worm-eaten tree; masons, who work with mortar made of earth tempered with saliva;
basket-makers, who weave together small twigs and fine roots; tailors, who with a
filament of bark for thread and the beak for needle sew a few leaves together into
a cornet for holding the mattress on which the young brood will rest; workers in felt,
who make a fabric of down, hair, or cotton, that rivals our own similar products;
and builders of fortresses, who protect their nest with an impenetrable thicket as
a rampart.
</p>
<p>“The goldfinch, that pretty little red-headed bird which feeds on the seeds of thistles,
builds a wonderfully <span class="pageNum" id="pb306">[<a href="#pb306">306</a>]</span>wrought nest in the fork of some flexible branch. The outside is made of moss and
the silky down of thistle-seeds and dandelions, while the inside, artistically rounded,
is lined with a thick cushion of horse-hair, wool, and feathers.
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p306-1width"><img src="images/p306-1.png" alt="American Goldfinch" width="158" height="276"><p class="figureHead">American Goldfinch</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“The chaffinch builds its nest in nearly the same way, but, more mistrustful than
the goldfinch, it covers the outside of its abode with a layer of gray lichen which,
merging with the lichen growing naturally on the branch, serves to baffle the scrutiny
of the bird-nest hunter.
</p>
<div class="figure floatRight p306-2width"><img src="images/p306-2.png" alt="Chaffinch" width="237" height="239"><p class="figureHead">Chaffinch</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“The window-swallow makes its nest in the corners of windows, under the eaves of roofs,
and in the shelter of cornices. Its building material is fine earth, chiefly that
left in little piles after its digestion by earth-worms in fields and gardens. The
swallow fetches it, a beakful at a time, moistens it with a little viscous saliva
to make it stick together, and deposits it in courses, shaping <span class="pageNum" id="pb307">[<a href="#pb307">307</a>]</span>the structure into a sort of hemispherical bowl fastened to the wall and having a
narrow mouth at the top to allow the bird to squeeze through. Bits of straw embedded
in this masonry of earth serve to give it greater solidity. Finally, the inside is
upholstered with a quantity of fine feathers.
</p>
<p>“The chimney-swallow chooses a similar situation for its nest and uses the same building-materials,
but the nest itself takes a different form. Instead of a hemispherical structure entered
by a very small opening, it builds a cup-shaped nest, of no great depth and wide-open
at the top.
</p>
<div class="figure floatRight p307width"><img src="images/p307.png" alt="Nest of a Swallow" width="149" height="204"><p class="figureHead">Nest of a Swallow</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“Swallows like to live together in large numbers, so that their nests are sometimes
found touching one another in colonies of several hundreds under the same cornice.
Each pair recognizes unerringly its own belongings and respects scrupulously the property
of others, in return for like respect paid to its own. There is among them a deep
sense of solidarity, and they render mutual aid with no less intelligence than zeal.
</p>
<p>“Sometimes it chances that a nest has hardly been finished when it crumbles to pieces,
the mortar used having been of poor quality, or else the masons, with injudicious
haste, having had too little patience to let one course dry before laying another
on top of it. At the news of this mishap neighbors of both <span class="pageNum" id="pb308">[<a href="#pb308">308</a>]</span>sexes hasten up to console the unfortunates and to lend their aid in rebuilding. All
apply themselves to the task, fetching mortar of the first quality, and straws and
feathers, with such ardor and enthusiasm that in two days the nest is completely rebuilt.
Left to their own unaided efforts, the afflicted pair would have needed a fortnight
to repair the disaster.
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p308width"><img src="images/p308.png" alt="European Oriole" width="234" height="194"><p class="figureHead">European Oriole</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“The golden oriole is one of the most beautiful birds of our clime. About as large
as the blackbird, it has plumage of a superb yellow, except the wings, which are black.
In building its nest it selects, in some tall tree, a long and flexible bough with
a fork at the end. Between the two branches of this fork a hammock is woven for receiving
the nest. Strands of fine bark that has become shredded by long exposure to wind and
weather are used for this work of art. These strands or cords pass from one side of
the fork to the other, enlacing them, crossing and recrossing, and thus forming a
sort of pocket, firmly fixed and securely hung.
</p>
<p>“Broad blades of grass consolidate the structure. Then in this hammock a mattress
of the finest straw and having the form of an oval cup is put together. The completed
work bears some resemblance to those <span class="pageNum" id="pb309">[<a href="#pb309">309</a>]</span>elegant little wool-lined wicker baskets that are used as nests for caged canaries.
</p>
<p>“The long-tailed titmouse, remarkable for its excessive caudal development, which
constitutes more than half the total length of its body, lives in the woods during
the summer season, and comes into our gardens and orchards only in winter. It is a
small bird with a reddish back and white breast. The stomach is tinged with red; the
neck and cheeks are white.
</p>
<p>“Its nest is built sometimes in the fork of a high branch in a clump of bushes, and
sometimes in the dense underwood of a thicket, a few feet from the ground; but it
is most often attached to the trunk of a willow or a poplar tree. Its shape is that
of a very large cocoon, and its entrance is at one side, about an inch from the top.
On the outside it is made of lichens like those that cover the tree, in order to blend
with the bark and deceive the eye of the passer-by. Fibers of wool serve to hold all
the parts securely together. To make the dome of the nest rain-proof, it is formed
of a sort of thick felt composed of bits of moss and cobwebs. The inside resembles
an oven with cup-shaped bottom and very high top, and is furnished with a remarkably
thick bed of downy feathers, whereon repose from sixteen to twenty little birds, arranged
with careful order in the restricted space no larger, at the most, than the hollow
of one’s hand. By what miracle of parsimonious economy do these twenty little ones
with <span class="pageNum" id="pb310">[<a href="#pb310">310</a>]</span>their mother manage to find room for themselves in this tiny abode? And how in the
world can tails ever grow to such length there?
</p>
<p>“The nest of the swinging titmouse is still more remarkable. In our country this bird
is hardly ever found except on the banks of the lower Rhone. It hangs its nest very
high, on the tip-end of some swaying branch of a tree at the water-side, so that its
brood is gently rocked by the breeze sweeping over the river.”
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p310width"><img src="images/p310.png" alt="Long-tailed Titmouse" width="268" height="367"><p class="figureHead">Long-tailed Titmouse</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“Why, I should think,” put in Emile, “there would be danger of the young birds’ spilling
out of such a swinging nest.”
</p>
<p>“Not at all,” replied his uncle. “The shape of the nest provides against that. It
is a sort of oval purse about as large as a wine-bottle, with a small opening at one
side, near the top. This opening is prolonged like the neck of a bottle and will at
the utmost admit one’s finger. To pass through so narrow an entrance, <span class="pageNum" id="pb311">[<a href="#pb311">311</a>]</span>the titmouse, small as it is, must stretch the elastic wall, which yields a little
and then contracts again. This purse, as I have called it, is made of the cotton-like
flock that comes from the ripening seeds of poplars and willows in May. The titmouse
gathers these bits of down and weaves them together with a woof of wool and hemp.
The fabric thus obtained is not unlike the felt of a cheap hat.
</p>
<p>“It would be useless to seek an explanation of the bird’s astonishing success in manufacturing,
with no implements but beak and claws, a textile that man’s skilful hand, left to
its own resources, would be unable to produce; and this success the bird achieves
with no previous apprenticeship, without hesitation and without ever having seen the
thing done by others. At the very first trial the titmouse surpasses in its art our
weavers and fullers.
</p>
<p>“The top of the nest includes in its thickness the end of the branch from which it
hangs, with the terminal twigs of that branch, which serve as framework for the nest’s
vaulted roof, while the foliage projecting through the sides of the nest protects
it with its shade. Finally, to secure greater firmness of support, a cordage of wool
and hemp is passed around the branch and interlaced with the felt of the nest. The
inside of this hanging habitation is lined with down of the finest quality from the
poplar tree.
</p>
<p>“Are you acquainted with the troglodyte or, as it is more commonly called, the wren?
It is the smallest of our birds, and it too is a master in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb312">[<a href="#pb312">312</a>]</span>art of nest-building. Clothed in reddish brown, with drooping wing and upturned beak
and tail, it is always frisking, hopping, and twittering,—<i>teederee, teeree, teeree</i>. Every winter it comes flying about our houses, frequenting the wood-pile, inspecting
holes in the wall, and prying into the densest thickets. At a distance it might be
mistaken for a small rat.
</p>
<p>“In summer it lives in the pathless woods. There, under the shelter of some big root
that lies close to the ground and is covered with a thick fleece of moss, it builds
a nest patterned after that of the swinging titmouse. Its materials are bits of moss,
selected for the purpose of making the nest undistinguishable in appearance from that
to which it is attached. The bird gathers these materials and works them into the
shape of a large, hollow ball with a very small opening on one side. The interior
is upholstered with feathers.
</p>
<p>“The magpie fixes its dwelling in the top of some lofty tree whence, as from an observatory,
it can spy from afar the approaching enemy. At the juncture of a number of branching
twigs that offer adequate support it plants its nest, constructed of interlacing flexible
sticks with a floor of tempered earth. Fine rootlets, blades of grass, and a few tufts
of down form the bedding for the prospective brood.
</p>
<p>“So far there is nothing to differentiate the structure from ordinary nests; but now
we behold the exhibition of a special talent on the magpie’s part. The entire nest,
and more particularly its upper <span class="pageNum" id="pb313">[<a href="#pb313">313</a>]</span>part, is surrounded by a thick rampart, a sort of fortified enclosure composed of
thorny twigs securely intertwined. One would take the whole thing for a shapeless
mass of brushwood. Through this rampart, on the side that is most strongly defended,
an opening is left of just sufficient size to admit of the mother’s entrance and exit.
It is the only door to the aërial fortress.
</p>
<p>“Let us turn now to a bird that builds upon piling. It is a warbler of large size,
called the great sedge-warbler or river-thrush. It selects a cluster of four or five
reeds that project above the surface of a pond, with their stalks rooted in the mud
under the water and growing near together. These slender piles, the tops of which
the bird brings into such proximity as may be desired and fastens with connecting
strands, are made to bear an interlacing of flexible materials, such as rushes, bark-fibers,
and long blades of grass. It is a basket-weaver’s job, with a framework of reeds as
a basis for the structure. Finally, in this basket, which is made much longer than
wide, is placed the nest proper, a warm little bed of cotton-like down, spiders’ webs,
and wool.
</p>
<p>“But this abode resting on piles above the water is exposed to two dangers,—the swaying
of the reeds which, bent over by the wind, might incline the nest so that it would
spill its contents either of eggs or of young birds; and secondly, the spring freshets,
which might rise so high as to submerge the nest. These dangers, however, have been
foreseen by the <span class="pageNum" id="pb314">[<a href="#pb314">314</a>]</span>bird. The nest is very deep, and furthermore the edges of the opening bend inward
and form a parapet. In this way is avoided the risk of a fall when the reeds that
bear the nest are swayed by the wind. Finally, since the sedge-warbler is at liberty
to build her nest at any desired height above the surface of the pond, she places
it always high enough to be beyond the reach of the rising water, even in great floods.
One suspects the bird of being able to foresee, months in advance, the coming inundation;
for she builds her nest at a greater or less elevation according to the high-water
mark destined later to be reached by the surface of the pond.
</p>
<p>“The cisticola is a small warbler very common in the marshes of Camargue, at the mouth
of the Rhone. Its nest is placed in the middle of a cluster of grass and rushes, and
takes the form of a purse with a small round opening. Fine dry leaves form the bed
on which the eggs rest, while other and larger leaves are fixed all around it to form
an enclosure.
</p>
<p>“For this work the bird turns tailor, cutting the leaves and lapping them over one
another. Along the border of each leaf it punches holes with the point of its beak
and through these holes it passes one or more threads made of cobwebs and the down
from certain plants. Its distaff for holding the thread—namely, the beak—does not
admit of using very long strands; hence the needleful, so to speak, goes only twice
or, at most, three times from one leaf to the next one. But no matter; the sewing
is strong <span class="pageNum" id="pb315">[<a href="#pb315">315</a>]</span>enough to fasten the whole into a sort of purse which keeps out the rain.
</p>
<p>“The orthotomus, or grass-warbler, a small bird of India, is an even more skilful
tailor, and in fact is commonly known as the tailor-bird. It selects two large leaves,
still living and attached to the branch on which they grew. These are brought together,
with their longer edges touching, and are sewed border to border with strong cotton
thread made by the bird’s beak. The seams run only half the length of the leaves,
in such a manner that the two together, hanging down as they do, form a conical sac
with its mouth upward. In this sac the nest is placed, hidden by its protecting envelope,
which so blends with the rest of the foliage that even after a person has once found
the nest he can with difficulty find it again.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>“In South Africa there is a bird scarcely larger than our swallow and known as the
social republican from its living in large societies with one nest in common. This
nest, a sort of bird village, is shaped <span class="pageNum" id="pb316">[<a href="#pb316">316</a>]</span>like an enormous mushroom, spreading out all around the trunk of a tree, which serves
as its stalk, while the lower branches also furnish their support. This colossal edifice
is of such bulk and weight as to make a wagon-load, and if one wishes to see the interior
structure it must be chopped to pieces with an axe. It is formed wholly of dry grass
arranged much like the thatch on our rustic roofs.
</p>
<p>“Indeed, this structure, built at public expense by all the associated birds, is nothing
but a roof, a dome, destined to shelter the real nests, which are attached to the
inside of the thatched covering. Here are to be found a multitude of round holes presenting
all together somewhat the appearance of a honeycomb. Each hole gives access to a small
cell, a veritable nest and the separate work of a single pair. The grass roof, then,
is built in common by the whole society, after which each family provides for its
exclusive use a little apartment attached to the lower side of the roof. The number
of inhabitants may reach as high as a thousand.”

<h2 class="main">MIGRATION OF BIRDS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“At the approach of the cold season,” Uncle Paul resumed, in his account of bird habits
and bird peculiarities, “before winter clears the fields of insects, covers the ponds
with a coating of ice, and whitens the landscape with snow, thus cutting off the food-supply
hitherto obtainable from the earth, many birds, especially those that live on insects
or frequent bodies of water and marshy meadows, take leave of their native land and
direct their course southward, where they will find a warmer sun and a more assured
supply of food.
</p>
<p>“They take their departure, some in large flocks, others in small groups, or even
each one separately. With no guide other than an irresistible impulse too mysterious
for us to explain, they traverse by successive stages immense tracts of land, cross
seas, and bend their course toward the countries of the south. Africa is the rendezvous
of our birds and of European birds in general.
</p>
<p>“After the cold season has passed, with the first fine days of spring the same birds
return to the regions where they were born, making the journey this time in the opposite
direction, from south to <span class="pageNum" id="pb318">[<a href="#pb318">318</a>]</span>north. They take possession once more of their groves and forests, their rocks and
prairies, which they know how to find with an inconceivable accuracy. There they build
their nests, rear their young, and gain strength for the coming journey; and upon
the return of cold weather they go back again to the lands of sunshine.
</p>
<p>“These periodical journeys are called migrations, of which there are two each year,—that
of autumn, when the birds leave us and go southward, and that of spring, when they
fly northward and come back to us. These semi-annual flittings take place all over
the earth.
</p>
<p>“The various species do not all fix upon the same time for their migration, but each
has its own calendar, from which it departs only very slightly. Some start well in
advance of the increasing chill and the lessening abundance of food, while others
do not leave their native land until driven by actual necessity, when the cold has
become severe. Thus our martin flies away for Africa as early as the month of August,
whereas the chimney-swallow lingers until October or even November.
</p>
<p>“The martins forsake our turrets and old walls, our steeples and belfries, while the
summer heat is still intense and the small flies on which they feed are still abundant.
It is not, then, any lowering of temperature that drives them away, nor is it any
lack of food that hastens their departure; but they have a secret presentiment of
the change of season that is coming in a few weeks; a deep-seated unrest, <span class="pageNum" id="pb319">[<a href="#pb319">319</a>]</span>which they cannot overcome, warns them that the hour for their departure is drawing
near.
</p>
<p>“If one desires to witness this anxiety that torments the bird when the time for migrating
arrives, he may do so by rearing in captivity a migratory bird caught very young.
The captive, though never having lived with its kind or had any knowledge of their
migratory habits, and furthermore having been kept in a cage with no experience of
cold or hunger, nevertheless, when the season for flitting arrives, shows agitation
and mental distress, and tries to escape from its prison—after remaining so quiet
and contented up to that time. Some inner voice—instinct we call it—says it is time
to go, and the captive is eager to be off. If the desire is thwarted, death follows.
</p>
<p>“To tear oneself from beloved haunts to incur the fatigues and perils of a long journey
is undoubtedly a painful decision; yet the bird courageously submits to the inevitable,
but in the hope of coming back again some day. The strong reassuring the weak, the
older ones guiding the young, the departing flock forms itself into a caravan and
takes wing for the south. The sea is crossed, the treacherous sea from which, at long
intervals, rises an island as halting-place. Many perish in the crossing, many reach
the goal worn with hunger and spent with fatigue.
</p>
<p>“The day for starting on this momentous journey is decided upon in a great assembly,
toward the end of August for the window-swallow, and considerably later, even as late
as November, for the chimney-swallow. <span class="pageNum" id="pb320">[<a href="#pb320">320</a>]</span>When once the date has been fixed, the window-swallows gather together daily for several
days on the roofs of tall buildings. Every few minutes small parties detach themselves
from the general conclave and circle about in the air with anxious cries, taking a
parting look at their native haunts, and paying them a last farewell. Then they return
to their places among their companions and join in noisy chatter on the subject of
their hopes and fears, all the while preparing themselves for the distant expedition
by a careful inspection of their plumage and a final touch to one lustrous feather
after another.
</p>
<p>“After several repetitions of these farewells a plaintive twittering announces the
fateful hour. The moment has come, it is time to start. The flock rises, the emigrants
are off for the south. If one of them has been marked with a red string around the
claw in order to be recognized, you may be sure you will see it come back the next
spring and take possession of its nest again with little cries of joy at finding it
intact and ready for occupancy after a few repairs.
</p>
<p>“With their vigorous wings the duck and goose, in their wild state, are ardent travelers.
On a gray day in November, when there are signs of snow, it is not unusual to see
passing from north to south, at a great height, birds arranged in single file, or
in a double file meeting in a point, like the two branches of the letter V. These
birds are a flock of either ducks or geese in the act of migrating.
</p>
<p>“If the flock is of no great size, the birds composing <span class="pageNum" id="pb321">[<a href="#pb321">321</a>]</span>it arrange themselves in one continuous file, the beak of each following bird touching
the tail of the preceding, in order that the passage opened through the air may not
have time to close again. But if the flock is a large one, two files of equal length
are formed, which meet at an acute angle, the front of the moving mass.
</p>
<p>“This angular arrangement, of which we find examples in the ship’s prow, the plowshare,
the thin edge of a wedge, and a multitude of utensils designed for cleavage, is the
most favorable for pushing through the mass of the air with the least fatigue. If
in marshaling their flying battalions the goose and the duck had taken counsel of
the engineer’s science, they could not have managed better. But they have no need
of others’ advice: instructed by their own instinct, they utilized long before we
did the principle of the wedge.
</p>
<p>“Moreover, to divide among all the members of the flock the excess of fatigue incurred
by the file-leader in opening a passage through the air by strength of wing, each
in turn takes the post of honor, the forward end of the single file or the point of
the angle formed by the double file. Its term of service ended, the bird at the head
retires to the rear to recuperate, and another leader takes its place. By this equitable
division of labor the fatigue does not prove excessive for any one bird, and the flock
leaves no stragglers behind.”

<h2 class="main">CARRIER-PIGEONS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Resuming the subject of bird instinct as illustrated by the migratory flock’s unerring
precision in finding its way over thousands of miles to a desired nesting-place, Uncle
Paul continued as follows:
</p>
<p>“How is it that so many thousands, even millions, of migrating birds can direct their
course through trackless space each to the particular rock or tree or nest left behind
six months before, when the yearly removal was decided upon to some southern region
a thousand miles or more distant? How, for example, does the frail swallow manage
to find again, at the return of spring, its tiny abode in the north when it retraces
the long journey of the previous autumn? In order that we may be sure it is the same
swallow returned to the same nest we tie a colored string, as I have said, around
the bird’s claw; and, lo and behold, when April comes, with it comes our swallow to
its dwelling under the eaves. It is indeed our identical bird and no other; it is
the very one that fashioned the nest of clay, cherished bit of private property now
so eagerly taken possession of once more. The owner’s demonstrations of satisfaction
and delight are convincing proof, even were the bit of red thread not there to dispel
all doubt.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb323">[<a href="#pb323">323</a>]</span></p>
<p>“If the swallow is able to find its nest again upon returning in the spring from the
land of the negroes, still more will it be able to find it after being removed merely
from its native canton to the neighboring one.
</p>
<p>“A mother sitting on her eggs or feeding her young is taken, let us suppose, put into
a basket, and carried quickly to a spot twenty or thirty leagues distant, where she
is set free again. The surrounding country is unfamiliar to her: she has never been
there before. Of the road over which she has just come she has not the slightest knowledge,
having traveled it in the darkness of a closed basket. No matter. With only a moment’s
hesitation she gets her bearings amid these strange scenes and takes flight toward
her nest as unerringly as if it were possible to see the very roof under which repose
her little ones. In a few hours we shall find her back again on her nest.
</p>
<p>“A like behavior under similar conditions might be witnessed in the case of divers
other birds noted for strength of wing and power of sustained flight. They would return
to their domicile in spite of the distance to be traversed and the unfamiliarity of
the intervening country. Maternal love can accomplish wonders. In order to save her
eggs from a chill or her little ones from starving in her absence, the mother-bird
exercises a geographical skill as marvelous as that displayed at the period of migration.”
</p>
<p>“I have heard it said,” remarked Louis, “that the <span class="pageNum" id="pb324">[<a href="#pb324">324</a>]</span>pigeon is very clever at finding its way over long distances, and that it is used
for carrying letters from one place to another.”
</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied Uncle Paul, “this aptitude for retracing the homeward way over vast
distances is shown to an extraordinary degree by some of our domestic pigeons. Economizing
all their strength for purposes of sustained flight, they have retained the wild pigeon’s
pointed wings, sleek plumage, and symmetrical form. We call these birds carrier-pigeons,
a name well earned, as you will see from what I have now to tell you.
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p324width"><img src="images/p324.png" alt="Carrier Pigeon" width="204" height="260"><p class="figureHead">Carrier Pigeon</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“A pigeon having a brood of young is taken from the pigeon-house, put into a closed
basket, and transported a distance of a hundred, two hundred leagues, or even further
if you choose—from one end of France to the other. There it is set free. It rises
in the air, circles about a few times as if to assure itself of the direction to be
followed, and then starts off in impetuous flight toward the quarter where pigeon-house
and young await its coming.
</p>
<p>“Does the bird catch sight of the pigeon-house as it circles about in the upper air?
By no means; the distance is too great. Even should it rise to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb325">[<a href="#pb325">325</a>]</span>height of the clouds, or to still greater altitudes, where moreover its wings could
not sustain it, it would be unable to see its home. On the journey to the point where
it was released it has had no passing glimpse of any object, shut up as it has been
in the dark basket. The region it now traverses it sees for the first time. Nothing
in the surrounding landscape is familiar, and yet its flight evinces the assurance
that comes from having a definite goal in view. With a speed of about twenty leagues
an hour it wings its way straight to the journey’s end. If the distance is too great
to be covered without pause, halts are made here and there for food and rest; then
the journey is resumed, swift as an arrow’s flight. Finally, at the end of some hours
or days, according to the distance and the duration of the halts, the bird reënters
the pigeon-house with its beakful of food for the waiting little ones.
</p>
<p>“In serious situations the carrier-pigeon is a valuable messenger. During the winter
of that terrible year, 1870–71, when the German hordes besieged Paris, no communication
was possible by ordinary means between the invested city and the rest of France, in
arms to repel the odious invader. With Paris rendered mute by its isolation, one might
have said that the heart of the country had ceased to beat. For communication between
those within and friends without, recourse was had to balloons and pigeons.
</p>
<p>“Certain persons of dauntless courage left Paris by balloon, choosing especially the
night-time for their departure in order to avoid encounter by day. <span class="pageNum" id="pb326">[<a href="#pb326">326</a>]</span>They carried with them despatches from Paris and a number of carrier-pigeons. Over
the enemy camps they went, to alight somewhere, far or near, at the pleasure of the
winds. Thus the provinces received despatches, newspapers, and private letters from
Paris. The car of the balloon was loaded with all these.
</p>
<p>“But how carry back to Paris despatches from the provinces? To leave a city by balloon
in any chance direction is not so very difficult; but to return by balloon to the
same city is practically impossible. The balloon goes as the wind wills, not as its
passengers would like to have it go. To seek to return by the means employed in departing
would be to compromise everything by incurring the risk of landing in the midst of
the Prussian lines.
</p>
<p>“The only remaining expedient was to use those incomparable aids, the pigeons, which
the aëronaut had taken with him on his departure. Released, one at a time, with despatches
enclosed in a quill and fastened to the bird’s tail, they flew back over the German
army to the pigeon-house; they reëntered Paris and brought news of what was going
on in the provinces.
</p>
<p>“Do not imagine that the winged messenger was able to transmit only a few words or
at most a few lines. It was not with a pen or on ordinary paper that the despatches
entrusted to the pigeons were written. By ingenious methods and with unheard-of delicacy
it was found possible to obtain characters so fine and sheets of paper so thin that
a roll of these <span class="pageNum" id="pb327">[<a href="#pb327">327</a>]</span>sheets weighing scarcely a gram and enclosed in a quill contained as much reading
matter as ten printed volumes. What a marvelous piece of work, that package of letters
fastened to the pigeon’s tail, that quill transformed into a library in which thousands
of persons—friends, kinsfolk, statesmen—communicated their projects, their fears,
their hopes! In this manner the mail service was maintained during those woeful times.”

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER LIX</h2>
<h2 class="main">SOME PREHISTORIC ANIMALS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Fossil remains of all sorts of animals, from the largest to the smallest, are found
embedded in stone. There are lizards which, if alive, would hardly find room enough
to turn around in many of our public squares, so monstrous is their size; tortoises
with shell as large as a small boat; fishes of strange formation; birds of a singular
character such as we no longer behold; and enormous quadrupeds that would dwarf to
insignificance our sturdy ox. All flying creatures of the air, all walking and creeping
animals of the earth, every form of life swimming in the water, are represented in
these fossil remains found in the heart of our rocks, but of a shape and often of
a size very different from those of our living animals.
</p>
<p>“These ancient creatures have never been seen alive by man, so far back in the past
is their period. After inhabiting the earth for a very long time, they disappeared
forever, to give place to other species. What remains of them consists chiefly of
bones, which from their hardness and their mineral character offer the most resistance
to the various destructive agencies. With the sole aid of these bones science succeeds
in reconstructing the exact form of <span class="pageNum" id="pb329">[<a href="#pb329">329</a>]</span>the animal. It also tells us what the animal fed on and what were its habits. By a
miracle of sagacity it resuscitates, so to speak, the ancient, dislocated carcass,
and makes it live again to the mind’s eye.
</p>
<p>“Fossil bones are commonly found embedded in stone quarried at considerable depths;
it needs the work of pick and chisel and hammer to free them from the rock. How did
they come to be there? In the same way as shells. If the creature lived in the waters
of a lake or of the sea, the mud at the bottom covered the body after death. If it
lived on land, the floods swept away its carcass and bore it to the river, which in
turn carried it to lake or ocean. Later the lake dried up or the ocean receded, and
the hardened clay left behind became the stone whence to-day are obtained the relics
of prehistoric forms of animal life.
</p>
<div class="figure floatRight p329width"><img src="images/p329.png" alt="Skeleton of Pterichthys" width="129" height="376"><p class="figureHead">Skeleton of Pterichthys</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“What, then, were these prehistoric forms of animal life that preceded man? Regarding
ourselves as related to the animals provided with bones, a sort of inner framework
sustaining the corporeal edifice, we may say in a general way that there has been
a gradual succession from lower to higher in structure. First appeared the fishes,
then came the reptiles, next the birds, after them the <span class="pageNum" id="pb330">[<a href="#pb330">330</a>]</span>quadrupeds, suckling their young, and last of all man, placed above all the rest by
his incomparable endowments.
</p>
<p>“Let us glance rapidly at some examples of the ancient denizens of land and sea. Look
at this picture. The back of the creature here represented resembles a little, in
its form and in its regular rows of scales, the tail of a fish; but the front—to what
can that be likened? What is the meaning of those large bony plaques arranged side
by side like the squares in a tessellated pavement? The animal is armed with coat
of mail, perhaps to protect itself from the bite of an enemy.
</p>
<p>“What is the purpose of those wing-like appendages that strike the flanks? Of what
use are those two short horns at the base of the forehead? What sort of a creature
can it be that thus singularly combines in its structure the tail of a fish, the shell
of a tortoise, the featherless wings of a bird, and the nascent horns of a ram? You
will never guess the answer, so different is the creature from any that are known
to you. It is a fish, but such a fish as no frying-pan of ours has ever had acquaintance
with, nor does the ocean now hold any more like it.
</p>
<p>“It goes back to the earliest ages of the world, and is called the pterichthys. Do
not exclaim at this name, as strange to our ears as the creature itself to our eyes.
Translated into our tongue, it means a winged fish. But did this fish of former ages
really fly? Assuredly not. It was too heavy, too massive, <span class="pageNum" id="pb331">[<a href="#pb331">331</a>]</span>to admit of that. Its wings were simply admirable fins for swimming.
</p>
<div class="figure p331-1width"><img src="images/p331-1.png" alt="Flying Fish" width="275" height="107"><p class="figureHead">Flying Fish</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“In the seas of our day there live certain fishes fitted for flying. Their lateral
fins, which are very long, open like large fans and enable them to sustain themselves
for some time in the air. Pressed too hard by a pursuing foe, they escape by leaping
out of the water and flying over the waves, clearing a certain distance before plunging
again into the water, as they must when their fins begin to get dry and to lose their
suppleness. They are called flying fishes. Compare these two pictures and you will
see how greatly the present flying fish differs from the ancient winged fish.
</p>
<div class="figure p331-2width"><img src="images/p331-2.png" alt="Pterodactyl" width="385" height="167"><p class="figureHead">Pterodactyl</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“And this other creature—what wild dream could have conceived such a monstrosity?
It has the head <span class="pageNum" id="pb332">[<a href="#pb332">332</a>]</span>and neck of a plucked bird; and it also has a bird’s beak, but an enormous one armed
with pointed teeth in each mandible. Its wings are those of a bat, one talon of each
claw being disproportionately elongated and serving as support to a wide membrane,
much as an umbrella-rib holds the stretched fabric of the cover. Its other talons
are free and are furnished with hooked nails.
</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd31e2944" title="Not in source">“</span>The hind legs and feet are those of the lizard. The body is covered with fine scales,
is marbled with touches of a darker color, and ends in an abbreviated tail. Take away
from this strange animal its bat’s wings, its long neck and its bird’s head, and you
will have something closely resembling the lizard, the creature that basks in the
sun on old walls, or that other one, larger and all green, which gives us a start
when it scuttles away among the dead leaves or in the dense growth of the hedge.”
</p>
<p>“And was it a lizard, then, or a bird?” asked Emile.
</p>
<p>“It was a reptile, certainly,” was the reply, “and it might be called a sort of lizard.
There were several species, varying from the size of a lark to that of a crow. Like
the bat, the animal left its retreat in the hollow of rocks and came out at night
to flutter awkwardly about in the air by the aid of its wings of stretched skin. With
its toothed beak it snapped up in their flight immense dragon-flies, the chief insects
of that time. Its hunger appeased, it took its repose on the ground, wings folded
against its sides, body supported by the hind legs; or else <span class="pageNum" id="pb333">[<a href="#pb333">333</a>]</span>it hung down from the rocks, suspended by its claws. Its name is pterodactyl, which
means wing-fingered.
</p>
<p>“Let us consider another of these prehistoric creatures. This time it is a bird, and
what a marvelous bird, too, my friends! Its beak, no less monstrous than that of the
pterodactyl, had likewise the two mandibles armed with a ferocious-looking set of
teeth. Pointed teeth in the jaws of a reptile, such as a lizard, crocodile, or serpent,
are nothing extraordinary; but in a bird’s mouth, that is unheard-of. To-day one would
search in vain all over the earth for anything like it. There are beaks of all shapes
and sizes, there are short ones and long ones, straight ones and crooked ones, strong
ones and weak ones; but all are toothless, as are the hen’s and the sparrow’s. What
a singular custom in the primitive bird, to adopt for beak the toothed jaws of the
reptile!
</p>
<div class="figure floatRight p333width"><img src="images/p333.png" alt="Fossil Remains of Archæopteryx" width="257" height="313"><p class="figureHead">Fossil Remains of Archæopteryx</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“And that is not all. This bird adopted also the reptile’s tail, but covered it with
feathers. Birds of the present day have a short, wide rump, from <span class="pageNum" id="pb334">[<a href="#pb334">334</a>]</span>which grow a dozen coarse feathers. The first bird in the order of time had its tail
composed of a long succession of little bones, each supporting two feathers. Here
is a picture of that tail just as it was found in the rock where the strange creature
left its remains. The bird to which the tail belonged is called by the learned an
archæopteryx, or ancient winged animal.
</p>
<div class="figure p334width"><img src="images/p334.png" alt="Mammoth" width="369" height="215"><p class="figureHead">Mammoth</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“One more of these monsters, and that will suffice. The animal that you see here is
the mammoth, a sort of enormous shaggy elephant, so tall that its back would have
touched the ceiling in most of our great halls. Its height was as much as six meters.
By its side the ordinary elephant, the largest of extant terrestrial animals, would
look no larger than a sheep beside an ox.
</p>
<p>“Its tusks, which had a pronounced backward curve, measured four meters in length
and weighed as much as four hundred and eighty pounds each. <span class="pageNum" id="pb335">[<a href="#pb335">335</a>]</span>What must have been the strength of a colossus carrying between its lips a weight
of nine hundred pounds as easily as a cat carries the hairs of its mustaches!
</p>
<p>“Man was already in existence at the time of the mammoth. Armed with sharp flint-stones
and bone-pointed arrows, he made bold to attack the enormous animal whose weight made
the earth tremble. He hunted it in the chase and feasted on its flesh. What a piece
of game when the giant fell into the deep ditch masked by a light covering of boughs
and foliage! The victim was then overwhelmed with masses of rock, after which there
was an interminable banquet for the whole tribe.
</p>
<p>“Let us go no further, but merely say in conclusion that the animals of to-day are
not the same as those of former ages. Long before the present species on land and
in the sea, there gradually made their appearance other very different forms of animal
life, which have now become extinct. Nowhere on the earth are there now living any
creatures like those that have left their fossil remains for our inspection.”

<h2 class="main">THE ORIGIN OF COAL</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Coal is a fuel of inestimable value. By the heat which it develops in burning it
gives movement to divers machines. It makes the locomotive move over the iron rails
and the steamship traverse the ocean. With its aid metals are worked, fabrics woven,
pottery is baked, glassware manufactured, newspapers and books are printed, tools
are shaped, and all sorts of instruments necessary to our daily activities are produced.
The arts and crafts have no more powerful auxiliary. If we had to substitute the heat
of wood for that of coal, our forests would prove insufficient.
</p>
<p>“What, then, is the origin of this combustible, which feeds an immense industry and
is the source of incalculable riches? Ordinarily a piece of coal has no great interest
for the eye. It is black, lustrous, formless, friable, without any definite character
to afford us instruction. One can learn more from the fragments of refuse rejected
by the miner as too poor in carbon, fragments in which the predominating element is
a kind of dark stone that splits in sheets. In these a surprise is lurking that will
tell us the secret of coal.
</p>
<p>“These laminate blocks, stone rather than coal, <span class="pageNum" id="pb337">[<a href="#pb337">337</a>]</span>show us, on the slabs that have just been separated by the blow of the hammer, various
wonderful designs in which we recognize without hesitation the imprint or mold of
some form of vegetation. There is no mistake about it; a plant has left its remains
there; we behold in very truth the leaf with its subdivisions and its veins. It is
all there, even to the minutest detail. It is really the leaf minus the green color,
for which is substituted the black of the coal. We should not obtain a more exact
representation if we ourselves took the imprint of some sufficiently firm leaf on
a soft plaque of clay.

</p>
<p>“Pending the time when some lucky chance shall bring you into the neighborhood of
a coal mine where you can obtain a laminate block that you can <span class="pageNum" id="pb338">[<a href="#pb338">338</a>]</span>split into sheets and thus discover for yourselves the vegetable imprints there concealed,
here is a picture that will show you what these curious markings look like.
</p>
<p>“What do you think of it? Have we not here what seems to be actual leaves, and very
elegant ones too? They are spread out with a care that would appear to indicate the
work of a painstaking human hand. Yes, these are real leaves, but turned to carbon
and firmly incrusted in their bed of black rock.
</p>
<p>“Similar imprints are found in great abundance in all coal mines. Certain coal-deposits,
several meters thick, are composed entirely of them, the smallest chip that one splits
off bearing on each face the markings of foliage. The whole is nothing but an accumulation
of leaves and broken tree-trunks. An entire forest, heaped up in one pile, would not
present an equal mass. Thus it is demonstrated that in coal are preserved the remains
of ancient vegetation.
</p>
<p>“During great floods the rivers of former ages swept away in enormous masses the trees
they had uprooted along the banks, together with the foliage washed into the current
by the heavy rains; then all this refuse was deposited in the mud at the river’s mouth,
or in some lake or bay. Thus were amassed here and there, under the water, during
a long series of centuries, the remains of primitive forests.
</p>
<p>“Fine clay became packed about these masses, molding itself with delicate accuracy
around even the <span class="pageNum" id="pb339">[<a href="#pb339">339</a>]</span>smallest leaf; the weight of the superimposed mud crushed the softened tree-trunks;
a gradual decay converted the whole into charcoal; and finally the ligneous mass became
a layer of coal. Later the waters changed their bed, driven elsewhere by upheavals
in the surface of the earth, and the previously inundated bottom-lands became solid
ground in which to-day we find coal under massive strata of rock.
</p>
<p>“Is it possible to distinguish the forms of plant-life whence has come our coal? Yes,
it is possible, so well preserved are the details of that life in the products of
our mines. Now an examination of the imprints left to us in the laminæ or leaves of
our stone book shows us that the plant-life of those remote ages in which the coal
was accumulated bore not the least resemblance to that of our present forests. And
this difference was to be expected. The animal life has changed; why, then, should
the plant-life have remained unaltered?”
</p>
<p>“Didn’t they have trees then like ours?” asked Jules.
</p>
<p>“No,” replied his uncle; “we do not find in our coal mines any signs of the existence
of trees resembling those of our day. Nowhere in the world, in fact, are there now
to be seen any such forms of plant-life as flourished so abundantly in those remote
ages; or if any still exist that are at all analogous, they must be sought in the
islands of the tropical seas. No vegetable growth of that coal epoch, whether tree
or bush or simple cluster of leaves, <span class="pageNum" id="pb340">[<a href="#pb340">340</a>]</span>bore flowers. The splendors of the corolla were not to appear until a later period.
</p>
<p>“For the most part there were only tall stems or stalks, without branches, of equal
size from top to bottom, and furrowed with channels or dotted with large points arranged
in spiral lines. At the top a tuft of enormous leaves balanced itself, the under surface
of each leaf bearing elongated or rounded swellings containing a fine brown dust,
each grain of which was a seed for the propagation of the plant.
</p>
<p>“Plants that thus bear their seeds, or spores, in powdery masses on the under side
of the leaves are called ferns. A number of species flourish in our part of the world.
They are unpretentious plants, fond of shade and coolness. Old damp walls, rocks that
drip water drop by drop, the darkest corners of our woods—these are the customary
haunts of the fern.
</p>
<p>“A short underground stock and a sparse cluster of leaves, very elegantly shaped,
it is true, constitute our native ferns. Those of the coal epoch were of a different
pattern. Some of them displayed at the top of a stem as tall as our poplars a cluster
of leaves five or six meters in length. They are called tree-ferns, and they contributed
the greater part of the coal-forming material.
</p>
<p>“The accompanying illustration will give you an idea of what the vegetation of that
period must have looked like. What strange trees! How different from our oaks and
maples and hemlocks! The soil is a liquid mud in which lie and rot the tree-trunks
<span class="pageNum" id="pb341">[<a href="#pb341">341</a>]</span>prostrated by the weight of years; the air is sultry, moist, heavy, strongly impregnated
with a moldy smell; and the density of the foliage barely admits a few sunbeams to
flicker over the surface of the stagnant pools.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>“Everywhere profound silence. No song of bird bursts forth from the foliage of those
tall fern-trees, for the bird is not yet in existence. No foot of quadruped treads
the ground, for the quadruped with its coat of fur will not come until much later.
Some lizards lurking in the rock-fissures, some large dragon-flies at the water’s
edge, some odious scorpions under the heaps of dead leaves—that is all the animal-life
to be found in the forests that gave us our coal.”

<p class="first">“By ‘helpers’ I here mean those animals and birds that come to our aid, though not
subject to our care and protection, and make war on the insects and divers other devourers
that would soon get complete control of our crops if we were left to our own resources
for preventing their excessive multiplication. What could man do against those voracious
hordes that annually propagate their kind at a rate defying calculation? Would he
have the patience, the skill, the keenness of eyesight necessary for effective warfare
upon the smallest of these marauders when the June-bug, despite its size, mocks at
our utmost efforts to exterminate it? Would he undertake to examine all his fields,
a clod at a time, to inspect his grain, ear by ear, to scrutinize his fruit trees,
one leaf after another? For so prodigious a task the combined efforts of the whole
human race would not suffice. The devouring hosts would eat us up, my friends, if
we had no helpers to come to our rescue, helpers endowed with a patience that nothing
can weary, an adroitness that baffles all wiles, a vigilance from which there is no
escape. To lie in wait for the enemy, to seek him in his remotest retreats, to pursue
him without pause or rest, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb343">[<a href="#pb343">343</a>]</span>finally to exterminate him, that is their sole concern, their incessant preoccupation.
They are implacable, pitiless; hunger urges them on, both for their own sake and in
behalf of their families. They live at the expense of those that live at our expense;
they are the enemies of our enemies.

<p>“As participants in this great work must be named the bat and the hedge-hog, the owl,
the martin, the swallow, and all the smaller birds, the lizard, the adder, the frog,
and the toad. Praise be to God who has given us as protectors from that glutton, the
insect, such birds as the swallow and the warbler, the robin and the nightingale,
the martin and the starling. And yet these invaluable creatures, guardians of earth’s
bounty, a delight to the eye, a solace to the ear, have their homes pillaged by the
barbarous and stupid robber of birds’ nests. Praise be to God who for the protection
of our daily bread has given us the owl and the toad, the hedge-hog and the bat, the
adder, the lizard and the mole. Nevertheless these useful creatures that come so valiantly
to our aid are cursed and calumniated, and we stupidly vent upon them our loathing
and hate.

<p>“By what perversity are we, in general, impelled to destroy animals whose coöperation
is so much to our advantage? Nearly all our helpers are persecuted. Their good will
must be indomitable to make them bear our ill treatment and not forsake our dwellings
and fields, never to return. The bat rids us of a host of enemies, and is nevertheless
under the ban; the mole clears the soil of vermin, and is likewise proscribed; the
hedge-hog wages war on vipers and cut-worms, and it too is an outlaw; the owl and
various other night birds are accomplished rat-hunters, and they also are in disfavor;
the adder, toad, and lizard feed on the ravagers of our crops, and all the while we
hold them in abhorrence. They are ugly, we say, and without further reason we kill
them. But, blind slayers, the day will come when you will perceive that you have been
sacrificing your own defenders to an irrational repugnance. You complain of rats,
but you nail the owl to your door and let its body dry in the sun as a hideous trophy;
you cry out against cut-worms, but you crush the mole every time your spade turns
one up; you disembowel the hedge-hog and set your dogs on him just for fun; you bewail
the ravages of moth and worm in your granaries, but if the bat falls into your clutches
it is seldom that you show him any mercy. Your complaints go up to heaven, but all
these willing helpers of yours you treat as creatures accursed. Blind fools that you
are, filled with an insane desire to kill!
</p>
<p>“Insect-eating birds are of immense importance <span class="pageNum" id="pb345">[<a href="#pb345">345</a>]</span>to agriculture. They divide among themselves the work to be done in field and hedge,
meadow and garden, forest and orchard, and wage unceasing warfare on every species
of vermin, a terrible tribe that would destroy our crops were not more vigilant guardians
than we continually on the watch—guardians of far greater adroitness, of sharper eyesight,
of more lasting patience in their endless quest, and having nothing else to do. I
am not exaggerating, my little friends; without insect-eating birds famine would decimate
us. Who then, unless he be an idiot with a mania for destruction, would dare touch
the nests of birds that enliven the country with their plumage and deliver us from
the devouring scourge of insects? But there are, nevertheless, bloodthirsty gamins
who, if they can manage to elude the school-master and play truant, find it a joyous
pastime to climb trees and explore hedges in order to rob birds’ nests and slaughter
the young. These good-for-nothings are under the surveillance of the rural guard and
liable to the utmost rigors of the law, to the end that our crops may still be protected
by the birds and that our fields and orchards may continue to yield sheaves of grain
and baskets of fruit.
</p>
<p>“Let us add a few words on the mode of life of these indispensable collaborators.
The bat feeds exclusively on insects, anything in that class serving its purpose,—beetles
with hard wing-sheaths, spindle-shanked mosquitoes, graceful butterflies, plump-bellied
moths of all kinds, such as make havoc of our cereals, vineyards, fruit trees and
woolen stuffs, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb346">[<a href="#pb346">346</a>]</span>those that come in the evening, attracted by the lamplight, and singe their wings
over the flame. Who shall say how many insects are snapped up by the bats in their
nightly tour of our premises? The game is so small, the hunter’s appetite so insatiable!
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p346width"><img src="images/p346.png" alt="Bat" width="264" height="148"><p class="figureHead">Bat</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“Note what takes place on a calm summer evening. Lured abroad by the mild temperature
of the twilight hours, a swarm of insects leave their retreats and come out to play
in the open air, to hunt for food, and to mate, one with another. It is then that
great night-moths fly abruptly from flower to flower and plunge their long proboscis
to the bottom of the corolla, where they suck up the honey; it is then that the mosquito,
eager for human blood, sings its war-song in our ears and chooses our tenderest spot
for the insertion of its envenomed lancet; and it is then that the June-bug quits
the sheltering leaf, spreads its resounding wings, and goes booming through the air
in quest of its kin. The gnats dance in joyous swarms which the least puff of wind
disperses like a column of smoke; the moths, their wings powdered with silver dust
and their antennæ displayed plume-fashion, indulge in frolicsome gambols or go in
search of favorable places for laying their eggs; the little wood-gnawing beetles
explore the <span class="pageNum" id="pb347">[<a href="#pb347">347</a>]</span>wrinkled bark of old tree-trunks; the wheat-moths rise in clouds from the ravaged
grain and take flight for fresh fields; and other night-flying insects flutter about,
alighting on grape-vines and fruit-trees, all busily searching for food and shelter
for their calamitous offspring.
</p>
<p>“But suddenly this scene of jollity is intruded upon by a most unwelcome kill-joy.
The bat, with zig-zag course, flits hither and thither, up and down, back and forth,
untiring of wing, appearing and disappearing, darting its head out this way and that,
and each time catching an insect in flight, which it immediately crushes and gobbles
up, sending it to its doom down a throat that opens wide from ear to ear. It is famous
hunting: gnats, beetles, moths, all are there in plenty, and every once in a while
a little cry of joy announces the capture of an especially plump victim. As long as
the fading twilight admits of it, the ardent hunter continues in this way his work
of extermination. Stuffed to repletion at last, the bat regains its dark and quiet
retreat; but on the morrow, and every day thereafter throughout the summer, the hunt
will be resumed, always with the same ardor, always at the cost of insects only. My
children, respect the bat, our helper in destroying the ravagers of our fields.”

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The hedge-hog’s diet consists especially of insects. The lowest order of vermin is
disdained by him as too small, but a June-bug larva or a fat-bellied cricket is a
capital prize, and when these are not too deeply buried he burrows with claws and
snout to unearth them. All night long he goes prowling around, routing out and crunching
a goodly number of our enemies, without doing any appreciable harm himself.
</p>
<p>“Listen now to what I am going to relate to you from the book of a learned observer.
‘I had in a box,’ he says, ‘a female hedge-hog with her sucklings; and I added to
the occupants of the box a vigorous viper, which coiled itself up in one corner. The
hedge-hog slowly approached and smelt of the reptile, whereupon the latter raised
its head and put itself on guard, showing the while its venomous fangs. For a moment
the aggressor recoiled, but only to resume the offensive immediately after and with
no sign of fear. The viper then bit the animal on the end of its snout. The hedge-hog
licked its bleeding wound, and in doing so received a second bite on the tongue without
suffering itself to be at <span class="pageNum" id="pb349">[<a href="#pb349">349</a>]</span>all intimidated. Finally it seized the serpent by the middle of its body, and the
two adversaries rolled together on the floor in a furious struggle, the quadruped
grunting and snorting, the reptile hissing and making repeated use of its fangs. Suddenly
the hedge-hog seized its antagonist’s head and crunched it between its teeth, after
which, without the least sign of perturbation, it proceeded to devour the forward
half of the body. That done, it returned to the opposite corner of the box and, lying
on its side, calmly began to suckle its young. On the morrow it ate the rest of the
viper. The same experiment was several times repeated, with an interval of some days
between each repetition and the next, but the issue was always the same: in spite
of wounds that set its snout to bleeding, the hedge-hog invariably finished by devouring
the reptile, and neither the mother nor her young showed any ill effects from the
experience.’
</p>
<p>“It is to be assumed that the hedge-hog has not received the gift of withstanding
the venom of reptiles only to leave that gift unemployed. The animal is evidently
intended to find its chief pleasure in haunting the places frequented by the viper;
in its nightly rounds among the underbrush it must often catch the lurking serpent
and make short work of the venomous creature. What valuable service it must render
in regions infested by this dangerous reptile! And yet man is the hedge-hog’s inveterate
foe, showering it with maledictions and treating it as an unclean beast good for nothing
except perhaps <span class="pageNum" id="pb350">[<a href="#pb350">350</a>]</span>to arouse the fury of dogs, which have to beware of its bristling back. Do not, my
children, imitate this evil example, but respect the hedge-hog for ridding you of
the cut-worm and the viper.
</p>
<p>“Now as to the mole, what does it eat? The best way to decide the question of an animal’s
diet is to examine the contents of its stomach. Let us, then, open the mole’s stomach
and see for ourselves. Sometimes it is found to contain red fragments of the common
earth-worm; sometimes a hash of beetles, recognizable from the tough remains that
have resisted digestion, such as bits of claws and wing-sheaths; sometimes, again,
and oftener than not, a marmalade of larvæ, especially those of the June-bug, with
their distinctive signs like the mandibles and the hard casing of the head. One finds,
in short, a little of every sort of game haunting the soil,—polypods and millepeds,
insects and caterpillars, moths in the chrysalis, underground worms and nymphs, and
so on; but the minutest scrutiny fails to discover a single particle of vegetable
matter.
</p>
<p>“The mole, then, is exclusively carnivorous, and furthermore it has a monstrous appetite,
a perfectly insatiable stomach that in twelve hours demands a quantity of food equal
to the animal’s weight. The mole’s existence is one gluttonous frenzy, ever renewing
itself, never appeased; a few hours’ abstinence suffices to kill the creature. To
still the anguish of that stomach, which is no sooner stuffed with food than it is
emptied again, what can the animal count upon? On the grubs living in the ground,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb351">[<a href="#pb351">351</a>]</span>and especially on those of the June-bug, tender and fat. It is a small creature for
supplying the wants of such an appetite, but its numbers make up for its littleness.
What a massacre of worms, then, must not the mole be credited with in the season when
worms abound! Scarcely is one meal finished before another begins, and at each repast
the worms must be gobbled up by the dozen. To clear a field of these formidable ravagers
the farmer has no helper equal to the mole. The only regret is that to reach the vermin
on which the animal lives, it has to burrow among the roots where they have their
haunts. Many roots that lie in the way are necessarily ruptured in this work; plants
are broken off and destroyed; and, finally, the little piles of earth, or mole-hills,
heaped up by the animal in the course of its excavations, impede the reaper when harvest-time
comes around. Never mind: the worms would have caused much more serious damage, and
to get rid of them there is nothing like this ravenous insect-hunter. Therefore, children,
never molest the mole, the protector of our crops.
</p>
<p>“The toad is harmless, but that is not enough to commend the creature to our attention.
It too is a helper of great worth, a greedy devourer of slugs, beetles, larvæ, and
every sort of vermin. Discreetly withdrawn by day under the cool cover of a stone
in some obscure hole, it leaves its retreat at nightfall to make its regular rounds,
propelling itself, hoppity-hop, on its ample stomach. Here is a slug on its way to
the lettuce-plants; yonder is a cricket chirping <span class="pageNum" id="pb352">[<a href="#pb352">352</a>]</span>at the entrance to its hole; and over there a June-bug is laying its eggs in the ground.
Master toad comes along in circumspect fashion, opens his cavernous mouth, and in
three gulps swallows them all with a gurgle of satisfaction. Oh, but that was good!
Now for some more of the same sort.
</p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>“He continues on his rounds, and when dawn begins to glimmer in the east what kind
of a hodge-podge of variegated vermin must there not be in the glutton’s capacious
maw? Yet they kill this useful creature—stone it to death because, forsooth, it is
not so handsome as it might be. My children, may you never be guilty of such cruelty,
such foolish and mischievous cruelty! Never stone the toad, for in doing so you would
be robbing the fields of a vigilant guardian. Let the poor creature perform in peace
its appointed task as destroyer of worms and insects.
</p>
<p>“Finally, and not least of all, must be mentioned the various birds, chiefly the little
birds of our fields and farm-yards, that help the farmer by devouring harmful insects
and the seeds of wild grasses and intrusive weeds. These indefatigable assistants,
however, we have already discussed, and we have gratefully acknowledged our indebtedness
to them. <span class="pageNum" id="pb353">[<a href="#pb353">353</a>]</span>No more, then, need be said about them at present, except in the way of renewed admonition
never to molest them, never to rob their nests; for they are our friends and benefactors.”

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
